The Rig Veda
For The First Time Reader
PREFACE
Knowledge in society has two dimensions, depth in individuals, and
spread across people and places and through time. The knowledge of
most people is conditioned by their own subjective and objective
experiences. But people of all climes and times have always recognized
that beyond the limits of what they know or sense externally or internally,
are vast areas of the unknown, to which they relate through faith in, or fear
of, a higher power that appears to control everything, both known and
unknown.
Every society and every age has always had a small number of
people, seers and sages, who have been able to see far beyond the
external physical world and deep into the internal world of thought,
emotion and intuition, for a more integrated and complete understanding of
all human experience. And they have found that subjective experience is
inseparable from objective experience and that they are indeed the
inseparable faces of the same coin. From this integrated understanding,
they drew guidelines for people of every level of understanding, for
handling their lives, which, in time, came to form their scriptures.
The Vedas too must have originated in much the same way, and
come to occupy a place of centrality in the lives of the Indian people. Of
course, this would be with features similar in many ways, to what has
evolved in other cultures, but in many ways, uniquely different. One refrain
for instance, that is common to many traditions, is the claim to a divine
origin for their scriptures. That the scriptures were the word of God is
affirmed as firmly by the Bible or the Koran as by the Vedas. Without being
drawn into contentious argument over such statements, it seems
reasonable and adequate for all practical purposes to interpret them to
mean that their scriptures found first expression through the minds of
seers and sages, which of course, in their humility, they attributed to
divine inspiration, and described as the word of God.
The Rishis who thus articulated the Vedas, were obviously
extraordinary men whose vision traversed the whole gamut of the inner
world of man and the outer world of the cosmos. Seeing everything within
a context of Infinity and Eternity, they articulated whatever they
experienced as best as they could within the vocabulary limits of the
language available to them, and possibly, adding sounds and words as
they found necessary or appropriate. And what they saw or sensed and set

into words, acquired the status of divine revelation for the Vedas,
represented by the words “Drushti”, meaning “What was Seen”, and
“Sruti”, meaning “What was Heard”. Their intuitive faculties did indeed give
them a reach into the highest sources of inspiration, to perceive the
highest truths, and explain them very simply as the divine word heard by
them. The world was described by them in terms of Nama and Roopa, or
Name and Form. And while Forms were just too numerous, there were far
too few Names available in the language to represent them. This resulted in
their extensive resort to symbol and synonym, and metaphor and analogy
to refer to the Forms, a feature of usage of the language that often went
beyond the understanding of scholars of later times who were simply not
attuned to the word usage and imagery of the ancient times. More often
they misinterpreted them to refer to myths or just plain superstition.
There are however, several other remarkable features that make the
Vedas unique among the world’s scriptures. They are now widely
recognized now as possibly
mankind’s oldest. Secondly, they are
unquestionably, the most massive and incisive explorations of man in the
fields of religion, philosophy and spirituality. And thirdly, they have come
to us in one of the most scientific languages devised by man, namely
Sanskrit. These claims to uniqueness are recognized by scholars from all
over the world, men of enormous scholarship and impeccable credentials,
and a sampling of what some of them have said in this regard is set out in
Appendix - A. These features will of course, soon become evident to the
reader himself as he starts getting glimpses into the Rig Veda presented in
this book.
One extraordinary and unique aspect of whatever we have today of
the Vedas, not to be found in any other culture, is that the texts retain their
entirety, accuracy and authenticity, and form a living presence in the daily
lives of the millions of India today, despite the fact that they have been
entirely orally transmitted through the numerous generations of several
millenia that have passed since the texts were composed. This is due to the
establishment even then, of six supporting disciplines, namely, Siksha
(Phonetics),
Vyakarana
(Grammar),
Chandas
(Poesy), Nirukta
(Etymology), Kalpa (Ritual Procedure) and Jyotisha (Astronomy and
Astrology). These disciplines, called the Vedangas, or limbs of the
Vedas, were intended to provide the strict framework; the first four,
providing rules for the composition of text, and the last two, the rules of
procedure of rituals, and determining the auspicious place and time for
their performance.
Specifically for the Vedas, these disciplines were
designed to ensure that the observance, propagation and preservation of
sacred texts in their pristine purity would endure for all time, despite a
completely
oral mode of transmission. In particular. remarkable
techniques of memorizing and reciting the texts, were designed and
prescribed, so that even today, priests and scholars, who have been
trained in this tradition, can pick on any word at any point in any
large text, and recite it from memory from that point for hours !

These disciplines enabled adoption of an extraordinary inter-locking
strategy to establish the above objective, a strategy operating at several
levels, and across vast spans of time and distance. At the most basic level
of this strategy, a strict grammatical structure of the language and the
meter of the compositions provided a rigid framework for the texts. Every
work also carried inbuilt references to the authorship and size of each
level of the component text. At the next level, highly developed teaching
methods resting on highly scientific techniques for memorizing the texts
were prescribed and followed, as indicated earlier, where recitation could
never go wrong. The texts were embedded into strict rituals, resting on
hope of rewards and fear of punishments, that commanded the
unquestioning faith of the common people as a whole, and become part of
the psyche of the people. And at the final level, successive generations of
teachers and disciples carried the Vedas to different parts of India,
and in the course
of time, the processes of their observance,
propagation and preservation got institutionalized into Sakhas or
Schools, each with a large membership, and each of whom preserved
and carried
forward
a
particular
Vedic
rescension.
The
Muktikopanishad has it that at one time, there were 1180 Sakhas in
existence, but only a handful survive today. Not counting several
fragments that have been retrieved over the years, the following is a
summary of the surviving complete Sakha-wise component texts,
preserved by the large membership of each Sakha :

It will be of special interest to the first time reader, to look, at the
outset, at a few examples of how the lofty thought, spirit, form and words
of the Vedas as they were composed over 6000 years ago, continue intact
as a living tradition in our daily lives in India today. One verse, for instance,
that is central to the prayers we offer today is the Gayathri Mantra that
occurs in the Rig Veda (V-62-10), and is attributed to the Rishi Viswamitra
The following is the Sanskrit text with a Roman transliteration and an
English translation :

‘ B¥: ‘ B¤v: ‘ s¤v:

The Mantra is invoked in the first line of above text with the holy
sound OM applied to Bhu, Bhuvah and Suvah, respectively representing
the gross Physical, the subtle Spiritual and the potential Causal planes of
all existence. The Mantra itself then follows in the next three lines which
translate as below :
We meditate upon the effulgence of that Divine Reality. May that Divine
Being, the Sun, illuminate our intellect to realize That Reality.
The use of the plural “n:” meaning “our”, may be noted : the prayer is not
for oneself, but on behalf of all.
To make the perspective complete, whenever today, anyone announces his
identity to his elders, it is always typically in terms of his inheritance of
this ancient tradition in the following words in Sanskrit which transliterate
and translate as below :

Bowing to you, Sir, I announce myself as belonging to the spiritual lineage
of the three Sages Viswamitra, Akarshmana and Kausika, to the family
lineage of the Kausika Gothra and to the religious disciplines of the
Apasthamba Sutra of the Yajur Veda, and I bear the name (so-and-so).

The reader will now see the truth of the statement made earlier that
the ancient tradition has a living presence in our daily lives today. Who
then were the Rishis like those whose names appear as above, who
founded this tradition, from whom we are descended, whose injunctions
we follow, and who composed the hymns that we recite today ? And who
was Vyasa who retrieved all the scattered remains of the thousands of
those hymns composed by hundreds of such Rishis in remote antiquity,
and compiled them into the single massive canon of the four Vedas, the
Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva, on which the ancient Indian tradition is
founded and has reached us today across the millenia ? And when did he
accomplish this ?
All that we know today of these ancient Rishis is that they were
quite a large number and lived in the 1000 years preceding Vyasa who
himself lived towards the close of the Dvapara Yuga which ended in 3102
BC, the year that marked the start of the Kali Yuga. One important point to
remember here is that the number of these ancient Rishis was large and
their output was prolific. Thus typically, the Rig Veda alone as compiled by
Vyasa, had 10028 hymns and are attributed to as many as 414 Rishis,
whose names are recorded in the Anukramanis, the Indices embedded in
the Veda text itself. The original composition of Rig Veda is considered to
have occurred over a time span of 1000 years or more, preceding the time
of their compilation by Vyasa at the time of the Mahabharata War, which
itself is placed at around 3102 BC. This would place the composition of the
Rig Veda, the oldest of the Vedas at around 4000 BC or perhaps much
earlier, because of references in the Rig Veda itself, to earlier ancient
Rishis. The above dating of the Mahabharata War, described in the great
historic epic of the same name, and composed by Vyasa. rests on its own
internal evidence, which is substantial and substantive.
Vyasa, is the great poet and visionary who not only compiled the
four Vedas and 18 Puranas, but also wrote the Brahma Sutras, a
monumental summary of all the Vedic texts, and also the Mahabharata
epic, in the events of which, he was himself personally involved. This
super—human feat gives him the status of a divine incarnation and he is
indeed listed as one of the seven Chiranjeevis, or immortals of Indian
tradition, and this is indeed true in the sense that he lives so vividly today
even after 5000 years, in the lives the millions of India. He is said to have
been born to the Sage Parasara through Satyavati, the daughter of a
boatman, who later married the King Shantanu, from whom the Kauravas
and Pandavas were descended. Vyasa was himself a direct witness to the
momentous events of the Mahabharata war and this itself invests the epic
with authenticity as a true history of those times. One cannot obviously
dismiss Vyasa simply, as modern historians have done, as a fictional
character, or at best a writer of fiction with his Mahabharata, at best a
historical novel.

The word Veda means Knowledge or Wisdom, and hence the four
Vedas constitute a vast compilation of Knowledge. The four Vedas present
an interesting approach on the part of Vyasa, their compiler. It is important
to consider that what he compiled was possibly a careful selection from a
vast corpus of material that was still available in the oral traditions of his
day. And in respect of the internal structure and content of whatever he
compiled, the Rig Veda is seen to be set in the poetic form, the Yajur in the
form of prose, the Atharva, a mix of prose and poetry, while the Sama Veda
had its hymns set to music. Within each Veda again, one can see a
progression of functional sequences, commencing with the basic
authoritative texts in the Samhita, their ritualistic context in the Brahmanas,
the rationale of text and ritual in the Aranyaka and ending with their
ultimate philosophical import in the Upanishads. The Rig, Yajur and Sama
traverse the progression from the early pastoral adoration of the powers of
Nature, through the personification of these powers as deities and gods
and finally to the ultimate single undivided Reality into which all existence,
subjective or objective, finally merge. The Atharva Veda alone stands apart,
in that its mantras address the more common experiences of the common
people – the world of distress and disease, the spirits that cause them, the
charms that prevent them and the medicines that cure them.
The Rig Veda is comprised, as its name indicates, of Riks or
hymns, of which there are 10028, not counting 11 supplementary hymns,
spread over 10 Books called Mandalas, a name that is also applied to the
stellar constellations. These are hymns of adoration of several deities
personifying the physical powers of Nature, and yet at the same time,
symbolizing the spiritual links that bind the human and the divine, and
maintaining and sustaining all that exists as part of a single Reality. The
sacrifices and the hymns that accompany them thus carry an appeal as
much to the common man as to the initiate. Most of the hymns address the
deities Indra (250), Agni (200) and Soma (100) while the rest address
different deities like Varuna, the Asvin twins, Ushas and Aditi. The Rig
Vedic text is composed in poetic form, set in as many as 15 different
meters, but mainly in the Gayathri meter, comprised of 3 sections of 8
syllables each and that takes its name from the Gayathri Mantra, cited
earlier. This is considered the most sacred Mantra of the Vedic canon, just
as OM is considered to its most sacred sound, standing for the first
manifestation of the Unmanifest.
The Sama Veda has 1875 verses, only 75 of them new, but the rest
taken from the Rig Veda. The Sama Veda is set to music and the chanting
of its verses is done by specially trained priests. The Yajur Veda has 1975
verses spread over 40 Chapters, and brings new dieties like Prajapati,
Vishnu and Rudra-Siva into prominence. One third of its verses are derived
from the Rig Veda. The Yajur Veda provides the textual and physical basis
of all the Vedic sacrifices or yajnas or ritualistic sacrifices. This Veda
provides the framework of ritualistic practice of Hinduism which remains

unchanged till the present day. The Atharva Veda lies possibly at the end of
the Vedic chronology. It has 5977 verses, about one-fifth of them being
derived from the Rig Veda. It deals with cures, charms and spells intended
to alleviate distress and disease. The foregoing facts of course establish
the Rig Veda is the oldest and also the source of much of the content of the
other Vedas. Indeed, all the scriptural texts of later times recognize and
proclaim all the Vedas as the ultimate source and infallible authority on
which their own authority rests. It does seem amusing that modern
scholars presume to question their authority or to pass judgment on their
intent, content or value.
What then is the significance of the Vedas being regarded as a Sruti,
a body of knowledge received from the divine source; specified indeed as
having been received from Brahma himself, and transmitted through
successive generations of seers; and from which all later scholars drew the
authority for whatever elaborations or additions they proposed. It is
possible that the Vedas, their massive size notwithstanding, were
themselves but a brief summary of the central truths of a much vaster
storehouse of accumulated pre-existing knowledge, but also providing
pointers to greater details that could be discovered in that storehouse, or
elaborated, or perhaps discovered afresh by later generations of scholars.
This seems indeed to be the case, when one sees that for centuries after
Vyasa’s compilations, vast clarifications and elaborations on the earlier
formulations and fresh contributions, by scholars in every branch of
knowledge, continued to pour into the mind-boggling Knowledge corpus.
Considered in this light, we can readily see how the Vedangas, the six
supporting Knowledge disciplines, were but the first logical clarifications
and elaborations that flowed from the Vedas.
One of the greatest misconceptions that is widely prevalent is that
the Vedas are primarily ritualistic in their intent and content. Even in its
own day, the Vedic scholars seemed to be aware of possibilities of a
degeneration of ritual if isolated from its true philosophical and spiritual
intent. Indeed the Chandyogya Upanishad has a charming verse, maybe
allegorical, and possibly satirical, in intent, describing a novitiate Baka
Dalbhya, instructing a pack of hungry dogs on chanting the following
sloka :

“Om, May we eat, Om, May we drink, Oh Lord of Food, bring food to us ” !
At the outset, on this question of the place of ritual, we need
to recognize that religion itself, whether considered rational or
not, fulfils a deep human need. Be it remembered that rationality itself

does not rest on absolute standards of any kind, but is necessarily relative
to state of knowledge that prevails at any time. And at all times, the
human mind recognizes that the individual is circumscribed by the
state of knowledge that obtains in the circumstances of his brief
existence. As a consequence, he has a fundamental need to
relate to whatever lies beyond the reaches of his physical and
cognitive faculties. As man gazes at the skies and the stars, he is filled
with wonder and awe. Reflecting on what power has created and
sustains the endless reaches of Creation, he settles on the word
"God", for the name of that Power, and this sets him on the path
of religion, where experience can be expressed only by special
words and symbols. And when he finds that rewards and punishments in
life come without rhyme or reason he becomes ready to attribute those to
the dispensations of a higher power and to place his trust in any
ritualististic prescription that placates that power.
No religion can therefore be free from symbolism, and ritual
and prayer are just symbolic expressions. All religions have their
share of prayer and ritual, and differences between them in this
regard are only in form or degree. And the prayer is mostly in
the form of the spoken word, accompanied by a posture like
bended knees, or a gesture like folded hands. The Vedic approach
to prayer proceeds from a deep understanding of human
psychology, where it prescribes a convergence of thought, word
and action. When these three components do not act in
concert, we have the beginnings of dishonest speech or thoughtless
action. Therefore the Vedic prescription for prayer rests squarely
on such a convergence, which implies that the involvement in
prayer must be total. The Gayatri Mantra derives its timeless appeal and
power from the convergence of its high thought, and the beautiful words by
which its thought is articulated. The exceptional person can, of
course, concentrate his mind on the spirit of the prayer, and
may have no need for the word, gesture or posture components.
But for the common individual, whose mind is given to
wandering, these components are essential, because they compose his
body, calm his mind and compel his attention. The offering of water,
a leaf, a flower or a fruit to the deity of one's choice, while
chanting the words and the faith with which the offering is made
are thus what makes the prayer complete. This, says Krishna in
the Gita (IX-26), is what makes the prayer acceptable to God.

There is yet another aspect to the true role and impact of ritual that is
so obvious, that it is astonishing that it is not emphasized enough by
scholars and historians. Why is is that the ritualistic Vedic tradition has
had such a phenomenal hold on the minds of millions of people through

vast periods of time ? Is there something in ritual itself that has this
phenomenal power, that is seen in every culture ? The real reason would
appear to be, that below the superficial mechanical aspects of observance
of a ritual, is the deeper psychological comfort and reassurance that
comes from the attendant faith in it’s power, that simply cannot be
rationalized or articulated. Here then, is a power that goes deep into levels
of consciouness of which we know little, and perhaps into the deeper
levels of the unconscious of which we know nothing. A few persons of
perception can understand these deeper levels, but the common mass of
people can only vaguely sense them without understanding them. But it is
precisely such a sensing, however vague, that is enough to account for its
power and hold on everyone, whatever be the level of the person’s
understanding. The depth and detail of the Vedic ritual clearly point to a
consciously devised structure that rests on the phenomenal power of
faith. Dismissing blind faith is clearly an all too common blindness to the
reality of its power. The Vedic prescriptions were clearly designed to cater
to people, guided by faith, often propelled by fear or desire, while also
clearly providing doors to higher knowledge and higher objectives. The
design also aimed, not just the advancement of the individual seeker, but
for an inclusive elevation of the human race.
The following luminous
words of Aurobindo point indeed to the awesome vision of the ancient
seers in the composing and of Vyasa in the compilation of the Vedas :
“The whole mass of its litannies may be only a selection made by
Veda Vyasa out of a more richly vocal Aryan past. Made by …. the collosal
compiler, with his face turned towards the commencemenet of the Iron
Age, (the Kali Yuga ?) towards the centuries of increasing twilight and final
darkness, it is perhaps only the last testament of the Ages of Intuition, the
luminous dawns of the Forefathers, to their descendents, to a human race
already turning in spirit to the lower levels and the more easy and secure
gains --- secure perhaps only in appearance --- of the physical life and of
the intellect and the logical reason”
The ritualistic emphasis in the interpretation of the Vedas was last
set, almost as a final seal, by the last ancient Vedic commentator, Sayana
(1315-1389) and it is on this, that the first Western scholars rested their
understanding, and that the Western colonists sought to use to subvert
and discredit the Vedic teaching, for the purpose of establishing political
control over the country. Specifically, the Yagna or sacrifice, occupied a
position of centrality in the Vedic texts and also in the vast spread of
ritualistic practice amongst the people. It is certainly inevitable that ritual
should find widespread appeal and acceptance among the common people
because it satisfied a basic psychological need on a very simple and
effective physical basis of objects and actions and on the motives on
which worship rested. But it is as important that the Yagna should be
understood in its spiritual, philosophical and psychological dimensions as

well. The progression of the Vedic texts from the Samhita, through the
Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads, themselves emphasized this. And
in more recent times, this was strongly re-emphasized by great Indian
scholars like Swami Dayanand (1824-1883), Bal Gangadhar Tilak (18561920) and Aurobindo (1872-1950).
The Vedic civilization is now acknowledged as one of the most, if
not the most ancient of the world’s civilizations, which greatly influenced
all other contemporary or later societies. Modern scholarship, while
acknowledging Sanskrit to a part of a common Indo-European heritage, has
nevertheless, all but rejected the theory projected by the early Western
historians, that the Indian civilization grew out of the Aryan invasion from
the West around the first millenium before the Christian era. The evidence
has been mounting that the Vedic civilization was indeed very much older
and very Indian in its origin and growth. The evidence is growing that
similar advanced ancient civilisations existed all around the world,
discrediting the Western theories that the emergence of the human from
the savage was a first and comparitively recent development. The evidence
is growing that there were extensive trade linkages by land and sea in
antiquity between India and the societies of the Middle East, the
Mediterranean and indeed as far as Mexico and Peru, which carried to
them, not only the arts and crafts and products, but also much of the
advanced knowledge and wisdom of India. While the knowledge that was
so passed on included the sciences of mathematics, astronomy and
medicine, it also extended to the higher insights of religion, philosophy
and spirituality that greatly influenced the thinkers and philosophers of
those cultures and triggered the onward growth of those ideas in those
cultures. History has now ceased to be a shallow narrative of kings and
queens, and wars and conquests, but has now become a study of man
himself without reference to dividing lines of nation or race. The study of
man has become a study of thought, because man everywhere is
distinguished by his thinking faculty. And as of now, no older or more
profound study of thought is known to exist than that of the Rig Veda.
The investigation of the age of the Vedas presents an interesting
study of history, or rather how the writing of history was largely dictated by
contemporary social or political factors rather than by an accurate
presentation of the objective truth. How these factors operated in the
reconstruction of ancient Indian History is broadly set out below. Over the
centuries, the history of the earth itself was the subject of a long
theological and impassioned debate by Christian scholars in the West. In
one 17th century study based on a literal reading of the Genesis in the Old
Testament of the Bible, along with an interpretation of an astronomical
reference in it of an autumnal equinox, James Ussher, the Anglican
Archbishop of Armagh (in what is now Northern Ireland) postulated that the
earth was created on the 23rd October, 4004 BC. This date was close to
dates proposed earlier by other distinguished names like Sir Isaac Newton

(who proposed 4000 BC) and Johannes Kepler, (who proposed 3992 BC),
the famous astronomer, whose astronomy tables were used by Bishop
Ussher, whose date was even quoted as an authority in the early St. James
versions of the Bible. The Ussher chronology starting from 4004 BC would
place the great Biblical Flood around 2448 BC and given a 1000 year period
for the impact of the great floods to subside, that would place a possible
founding of all new societies after 1400 BC. Much as this chronology came
to be disregarded and even ridiculed from the 19th Century onwards, it did
still have a considerable following among theologians and historians of
that time, and in particular, historians tended to use it as a benchmark for
their theories on the chronology of all societies, and for denying older
chronologies claimed for other ancient ones.
Two important political factors seemed to be in play at that time.
One was the drive for world domination through colonial expansion by
Britain and Europe springing from the desire for economic power, a desire
also conditioned by feelings of racial superiority and Christian fervour. One
far reaching impetus came from the ‘discovery’ of Sanskrit by Sir Wllliam
Jones (1786), a distinguished scholar and Judge of the High Court of
Calcutta. He was one of the first Britishers who not only mastered the
Sanskrit language, but found an extraordinary range of similarity to most
of the European languages, that clearly pointed to a common linguistic
heritage. The following table, typically, of the names of the numerals in the
different Indo-European languages provides a quick look at these striking
similarities.

Sir William Jones became recognized as the founder of the new discipline
of comparitive linguistics His discovery gave a powerful impetus to an
interest, especially in Europe, not only in the Sanskrit language itself, but
in its implications of a possible common indo-European cultural and racial

heritage. Deeply divided by the politics of Europe, the Germans were then
casting around for their own fulfilment as a people of racial superiority and
a destiny as a strong nation. Their search found expression in high
academic excellence, with one line of activity leading to their interest in
the deep study of Sanskrit and a fascination with the culture of India.
These studies starting from comparitive linguistics went on the launch of
the two new disciplines of Philology and Indology. At the same time it
happened that the British who were directly involved in administering India,
were increasingly realizing that their success in establishing British
authority in India rested on a study of Sanskrit, the bedrock of Indian
culture, in order to understand its extraordinary hold over the entire
people. With such an understanding, they felt that they could then subvert
that culture and supplant the Hindu with the Christian faith through an
Engish education.
It was this extraordinary confluence of historical circumstance
that led to a meeting in December 1854, at Oxford, of Lord Macaulay (18001859) with Max Muller (1823-1900) the German scholar, one of the rising
stars of the time in the world of Sanskrit learning. Lord Macaulay who had
shaped the beginnings of the British hold on India through the East India
Company, now commissioned Max Muller to undertake a full-time study of
Sanskrit that would be of help to the British for their purposes in India.
This led Max Muller, to become one of the pioneers of Indological studies
with his monumental work, The Sacred Books of the East, where he
presented his translations of the Vedic corpus.
Given the close
correspondence of the Vedic language, Sanskrit, to the European
languages, that had been observed by scholars at that time,
and
interpreting the Sanskrit word, Arya, to refer to a superior Aryan race, it
was a short step for Max Muller and other scholars of the time to assume a
superior Aryan origin and identity for Europe and propose the theory of an
Aryan invasion, spreading out from the West towards the East and
establishing the Vedic civilization in India by 1200 BC. Here then indeed
was a complete theory that provided an Aryan identity and racial
superiority that could be deeply satisfying to the German people who were
yearning for such a higher identity, and that indeed, in later years, was to
be embraced by the Nazi ideology.
Max Muller’s conclusions were questioned by the great German
scholar, Hermann Jacobi (1894) and the great nationalist Indian Bal
Gangadhar Tilak (1893). They were Max Muller’s contemporaries, and their
work which was known to him, pointed to astronomical reference to an
equinox in the Rig Veda itself that suggested a historical chronology for
India that reached back as far as 4000 BC. Yet Max Muller’s preference for a
Vedic origin in the Aryan Invasion from the West in 1200 BC prevailed,
perhaps because of the prevailing Western bias in favour of the Biblical
evidence behind it, rather than the evidence of the Rig Veda, even though
both referred to astronomical evidence in support of their respective

chronologies. Muller’s awesome authority as a scholar also tended to
guide most scholars, and overshadow all other viewpoints for a very long
time. But in his last book “Six Systems of Indian Philosophy, published in
1900, Muller himself did seem to sense a lack of finality in respect of the
speculations on the age of origin of the Vedas, when he commented
“Whatever may be the date of the Vedic hymns, whether 1500 or 15000 BC,
they have their unique place and stand by themselves in the literature of
the world”. It is possible that he was disappointed that the British whose
purposes he had served so well, denied him the Boden Chair for Sanskrit
Studies at Oxford which he thought he deserved, and instead gave it to Sir
Monier Monier-Williams. It would however be fair to Max Muller, in the light
of his comments quoted above, and the great scholar that he was, to say
that his higher academic instincts may have prevailed towards the end of
his life.
It is also to be noted that the Western studies of Sanskrit and the
Vedic texts of those times, remained for long, restricted to a superficial
philological approach which lacked the sensitivity and sophistication of
later times, with very little attention to any evidence in them of possible
historical relevance. Their translations rested largely on the authority of
Sayana’s 14th. Century commentary of the Vedic texts, that was focussed
on their ritualistic content and purpose. This was not easy for the Western
mind to correctly understand and much less, interpret. And the mindset of
those times, misled by literal understanding, led them quite readily to
dismiss the ritualistic content that dominated the texts, as depriving the
texts of all historical relevance. More importantly, the scholars who
engaged in these studies had no moorings in the sciences, where the great
advances of later times enabled later scholars, along with far greater
mastery of the linguistic nuances of Sanskrit, to open whole new vistas
and perspectives in which the texts could be better understood and
interpreted.
The point of this narrative is simply that it suggests that it was
not just a love of a genuine study of history or of human progress, but the
shared objectives of Western Christian evangelism and the racially driven
colonialism that would appear to have given birth to the theory of the Aryan
invasion. Macaulay seemed indeed to achieve phenomenal success in
establishing the theory through the country-wide system of English based
education and administration that he established in India, to the point that
even Indian historians accepted the theory, in denial of their own cultural
moorings. The Indian History Establishment, as it is called, even today
suffers the basic weakness of inadequate familiarity with the spirit of the
Vedic tradition and the subtle metaphoric nuances of the Sanskrit language
in which it is clothed and is largely influenced by English translations and
interpretations by Westerners or their methods. Those translations not only
miss the spirit and subtlety of the original text but import distortions,

unwitting or conscious, of interpretations that have great potential for
damage to or distortion of correct understanding of history.
The Establishment therefore remains even today, largely wedded
to the Aryan invasion theory, or modifications of it, though now for
different political reasons. The vast socio-economic inequities into which
the ancient Vedic tradition degenerated over the centuries, and
characterize Indian society to this day, are under severe challenge by the
disadvantaged classes, who are now being urged by the newly emerging
political forces, to see their condition as the direct result of control and
influence over their lives, by the Brahminical class upholding the elitist and
exclusive Vedic ideology. By identifying this class with a foreign Aryan
race, exploiting an indigenous population, history today is being shaped by
class ideology of power politics, that is purely Marxist or plainly communal.
In this era of vast socio-economic transition, the Indian History
Establishment has little choice but to maintain the silence of the status
quo, rather than stick their necks out and get silenced by the dominant
political forces. Thus politics of today, as indeed of the past, finds
advantage in shaping history to its purposes. These vast distortions that
come in the way of man’s adherence to or search for truth are best
explained in the ancient texts as the work of the forces of darkness or as
best expressed by the resolve of Satan in the words of Milton in Paradise
Lost : “Till I in Man residing through the Race, His thoughts, his looks,
words, actions all infect, And season him thy last and sweetest prey.”
It must be clearly stated here that whatever has been stated
above is not to detract from the enormous contribution of the British rulers,
or Western scholars. We need to be generous enough to say that they were
products of their times, and cannot be blamed entirely for the negative
aspects of the compelling circumstances that shaped their lives, views and
actions. The work of Max Muller and scholars like him is awesome in terms
of the range and depth of their studies and presentations. Max Muller
himself has been in fulsome praise of the Vedic contribution of India. In
ringing words that reached deep into the minds of the West, he said, “If I
were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully developed
some of it’s choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered on the greatest
problems of life, and has found solutions of some of them which will
deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant – I
should point to India. And if I were to ask myself from what literature we,
here in Europe, we who have been nurtured almost exclusively in the
thoughts of Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may
draw that corrective which is most wanted in order to make our inner life
more perfect, more comprehensive, more universal, in fact, more truly a
human life, not for this life only but a transfigured and eternal life – again I
should point to India”.

Luckily the Vedic tradition does not depend on the indulgences
of transient forces of time and circumstance, because the tradition lives
deep in the psyche of millions of people and has shown its capacity to
survive intact for so many millenia, despite the invasions and upheavals of
the intervening times. But what is particularly
encouraging is the
emergence of a new generation of scholars, both from India and other
countries of the world, of impeccable integrity, with far greater mastery of
philological principles and linguistic nuances, rooted in true scientific
attitude, and equipped with a phenomenal range of new and powerful
scientific tools of such disparate disciplines as ecology, genetics,
chemistry, mathematics, astronomy and computers, to unveil the vast
truths that are embedded in the texts of the Vedic corpus. Some of these
great developments are presented in detail in this book. The new
understanding and visions, not constrained by political and religious
biases, were triggered by a first generation of great scholars like
Aurobindo Ghose and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. To these must be added the
new contemporary generation of scholars, steeped in Indian culture and
trained in the Sciences like K.D.Sethna, Subhash Kak, Georg Feuerstein,
David Frawley, K.L.Kashyap, Narahari Achar, and Shrikant Talageri
Western contributions have been of inestimable value, also in
quite another context. The British no doubt, contributed to the distortion of
Indian history by establishing the theory that the Vedic civilization was
established by the Aryan invasion of India, through the teaching of history
in schools and universities in India and also building upon it through
History Establishment of the country. But they also contributed to building
the administrative structures for Archeological investigations, which, by a
strange twist of circumstance unveiled the ancient civilization of Harappa
and Mohenjodaro, which ultimately led to the demolition of the Aryan
Invasion Theory. An even more valuable British contribution through the
educational system was the opening of the approaches and methods of
Science through the medium of the English language, that has enabled
scholars in India, to not only to master all branches of modern knowledge
but use them to correctly understand and interpret the Vedic texts and
establish that India was the first to master of all branches of knowledge in
the ancient world as well.
The excavations in the area of the Harappa civilization has thrown
up impressive evidence that the area was indeed an integral part of the
Vedic civilization that covered both the Indus-Saraswathi valley and the
Gangetic valley, but survived largely in the latter, when the former area was
overtaken by geological and ecological upheavals around 2000 BC. What
survives today, through over 7 or 8 millenia, is very much the direct
successor of the Vedic civilization which must have initially encompassed
the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and gradually embraced the rest of the country. If
today the Vedic tradition is a living presence in the every day lives of its

people, then we must certainly recognize that the Vedic texts have some
power in them that compelled their unquestioning acceptance of the
authority of the Vedas by vast millions through these vast millenia. Our
understanding of this central fact of Indian tradition and history, must
surely begin with a study of the Rig Veda.
Taking the Rig Veda then as the first and oldest source, we may
see at the very outset, the awe-inspiring perspective in which it emerges
and presents itself. It presents all existence, in both its micro-cosmic and
macro-cosmic aspects, as set in a single framework of a Consciousness,
Time and Space ranging from the Consciouness within the transient
existence of the individual to the Infinite and Eternal existence of a cosmos
pervaded by a Supreme Consciousness. It traces the evolution of OM, the
primeval sound of the Cosmos, into the letters, words and speech of the
language, personified by Saraswati, the goddess of Speech. Names, and
descriptions of events and experiences are shared by men, stars, powers
and divinities. Indra and Vrtra at once personify respectively, the power of
Nature that brings Rain and the forces of the Cloud that holds it back; or
represent respectively the hold of Light and Darkness on the Mind.
Saraswathi is at once a goddess and also a mighty river, conferring the
gifts of learning and wealth. Vasishta and Arundati are not only the great
sage and his wife, but also a pair of stars in the sky, symbolizing marital
harmony, and at which newlyweds are required to gaze, to obtain the
blessing of the same marital felicity. Time and distance are measured from
the stars and scaled down to apply to men’s structures and activities. The
sacrifices are events of interactive exchanges between men and gods who
place the powers of Nature at the service of mankind. All these are clothed
in the Rig Veda in language, often simple and direct but more often
metaphoric or symbolic, that can be obscure to all but those who know the
nuances of the language or the ideas that it conveys.
One of the most incisive and insightful recent studies of the Vedas
has been from Shrikant Talageri, a scholar of the highest order from
Maharashtra. Proceeding entirely from a profound in-depth linguistic
analysis of the vast corpus of both Vedas and the Puranas, he has thrown
up a completely new scenario for the history of those times. Not resting
merely with a complete refutation of the Aryan Invasion Theory and its
projecting a Western origin for the Vedic civilization, he has literally
reversed the direction of the West to East movement of that view of
history. He has now presented a compelling body of internal evidence of
the Vedic corpus through an interpretation of those texts at a level of
sophistication not seen from scholars so far. He begins with building a
logical internal chronology for the Vedas and linking the clear internal
cross-references to events, also found in the text of the Puranas. He then
proceeds to reconstruction of the history of the Vedic period, which
involved not only a consolidation of the ancient culture in the Vedic

heartland of the Punjab and the Gangetic valley, but a movement of large
segments of its discordant elements who carried elements of the culture,
language and knowledge through North-Western India into Afghanistan,
Iran, Iraq, Egypt and beyond to Europe, thus accounting for the common
strands of an Indo-European language and knowledge heritage. Talageri’s
studies, resting mainly on an incisive linguistic analysis and understanding
of the Vedic corpus, has provided a profound complementarity to the
studies that are based on the Science-based disciplines, and has all but
marked the end of the old Aryan Invasion Theory and its attendant
founding of the Vedic civilization. In its place he has provided a new
cohesive and logical picture of the Vedic Civilization being entirely
indigenous to India, and also as a source of much of Vedic language and
knowledge tradition that contributed much to the later civilizations of Iran,
the middle East and Europe.

The Rig Veda
For The First Time Reader
INTRODUCTION
It would be appropriate to provide a brief Introduction to the
intent of this book and how it’s content has been structured to fulfil that
intent. This book is for the first time reader, especially the young one, of
every culture, to demonstrate that the approach of the Indian scriptures is
at once completely humanistic and totally universal in its reach and has a
validity and relevance for all time. But because of the sheer size, the range
and depth of the experiences that are addressed, the enormous difficulties
of interpretation and understanding of the usages of the Sanskrit language,
and its extensive use of metaphor and analogy to express exoteric and
esoteric ideas, the Rig Veda can be a formidable challenge to the mind-set
of the modern reader, especially the first time reader.
This book therefore seeks to make the reader’s task as simple
and manageable as possible, and in a language and idiom that will be
easier to understand and accept. The content may be approached from any
perspective to which the reader is pre-disposed: literal,
religious,
philosophical or spiritual. Specifically the book is built around a very small
set of the original Sanskrit slokas of the Rig Veda, each with an English
transliteration and translation, spread over ten basic chapter topics, and
set in simple explanations and perspectives, that attempt to encapsulate
their essential spirit, reach and relevance. This hopefully, will provide the
first time reader with a compass to find his way in his onward exploration
of the Vedas. Such an exploration may well be likened to a modern Space
expedition, but originating from the depths within himself and stretching
into the cosmos outside of him, where, at any point, he may be prepared to
meet with Sages and Seers, Planets and Stars, Powers and Divinities, and
a Light which illuminates the endless reaches of Infinity and Eternity.

Chapter - 2 : The Cosmos, Space and Time
The ancient Indian tradition holds Eternity, to be a never-ending
cycle of finite periods of Time, called the Kalpa. The following is a
beautiful account by a distinguished Scientist-Sanskritist scholar,
Dr.V.Krishnamurthy, of this time scale. The Kalpa was subdivided into units
measured on two scales, one cosmic and the other human. The Kalpa itself
was but a cosmic day in the life of Brahma, the Creator, who himself had a
finite life span of 100 cosmic years, each of which was comprised of 300
cosmic days and 300 cosmic nights. The Universe was created by Brahma
at the beginning of each cosmic day and dissolved at the beginning of
each cosmic night. How does the cosmic day relate to the human day ? The
cosmic day, or Kalpa, is equal to 4.32 billion years on the human scale as
explained below.
THE MANVANTARA
The Kalpa is divided into 14 Manvantaras, each ruled on behalf of
Brahma, by a Manu. The following is the sequence of the Manvantaras :
Past

: SWAYAMBHUVA; SWAROCHISHA; UTTAMA; TAAMASA, RAIVATA;

CHAAKSHUSHA

Current : VAIVASVATA
Future : SAVARNI; DAKSHA SAVARNI; BRAHMA SAVARNI;

DHARMA SAVARNI

THE MAHAYUGA & YUGA
Each of the 14 Manvantaras is divided into 71 Mayayugas and are
separated from one another by an interval called a Sandhya. There are thus
15 separating Sandhyas which together last 6 Mahayugas. Thus the total
duration of the Kalpa is (14 x 71) + 6 ie 1000 Mahayugas. Each Mahayuga
breaks up to a repetitive sequence of 4 Yugas, viz Satya (or Krita), Treta,
Dvapara and Kali Yuga with the following breakup:
Satya(Krita)
Treta
Dvapara
Kali
Total

17,28,000
years
12,96,000
years
8,64,000
years
4,32,000
years
--------------------------------------43,20,000
years
--------------------------------------

We are to-day in the Kali Yuga of the twenty-eighth Mahayuga and
the Kali Yuga began in 3101 B.C. If Brahma had a clock like ours, every
43.2 seconds on it would be equal to 1 Mahayuga on the human scale. One
of our days in 1995 would show as 11-29 A.M. on what is "to-day" for Him.

On the human scale, around 1,972,949,100 years have passed since the
present Kalpa, which is his "to-day", began.
It would be appropriate to refer at this point to refer to the finer
divisions within the human year :
12 months per year
30 days per month
24 hours per day
60 ghatikas per day (1 ghatika = 24 minutes)
60 palas per ghatika
6 asus (breathing) one pala
1 asu = 2.5 kasthas (the time interval of 4 seconds)
1 kastha = 4 dirgha matras
This panoramic view of our sense of time as a finite part of Eternity
comes from the Srimad Bhagavatam, a great and revered work of 1,00,000
verses in Sanskrit, ascribed to sage Vyasa. And it places at different points
of the vast time span of the present Kalpa all the great and revered figures
that vividly live even to-day in the minds of the millions of India. The
Matsya Avatar comes in the dawn before the break of the present Kalpa.
The Varaha and Narasimha Avatars along with Dhruva, later immortalised
as the Pole Star, come in the first Manvantara of the new Kalpa. This Kalpa
is called the Svetavaraha Kalpa as it was ushered in by the Varaha Avatar.
Rama , Krishna and Vyasa come in the Dvapara Yuga of the twenty-seventh
Mahayuga of the seventh Manvantara.
The Bhagavatham is replete with vivid stories of all these central
characters and events that appeared at different points of the vast span of
this Kalpa. One charming story it has, tells of a character who traversed
the vast time span of the first 27 Mahayugas of the current Vaivasvata
Manvantara. Kakudmi was a king who lived on earth in the Satya Yuga of
the first Mahayuga of the current Manvantara. Searching for a good match
for his beautiful daughter Revati, he went to Brahma Loka, the world of
Brahma, to get his advice. There, he had to wait for around 20 minutes (on
the cosmic scale) for Brahma to return from watching a dance
performance. Seeing him, Brahma told Kakudmi that during this period of
his waiting, 27 Mahayugas had already elapsed on earth, and if he
(Kakudmi) were to return now, he would find people on the earth enjoying
the avatar of Krishna. In addition, he would also find in Krishna's brother
Balarama, the right match for his daughter. Kakudmi followed Brahma's
advice and thus it was that Revati came to be married to Balarama. Can
science fiction of today produce a more imaginative and charming story ?

It would be interesting to note that whatever prayer people in India
engage in today, always commences with a Sankalpa, a statement of
resolve, that sets out the time and place of its offering in the following

What could be a greater indicator of an ancient tradition in a living
presence in our daily lives today, expressed as our existence as a tiny dot
in the Infinite and Eternal dimensions of this Cosmos !
The great attention given by the ancients to Time, within a common
cosmic and terrestrial framework is related to the importance given by
them to the timing of ritual sacrifices where the individual, the Purusha of
the microcosm, is brought in touch with the divine, the Purusha of the
macrocosm. Time, inevitably, is determined by the stars of the cosmos and
what time is auspicious and what time is not is determined by the vast
body of empirical observation and correlation of the concurrent timing of
both celestial and terrestrial events and codified into a common framework
of Astronomy and Astrology, which comprise the Jyotisha Vedanga.

The modern mindset of Science draws an arbitrary line between
physical and human events, where the former are predictable and the latter
are not. There is an inherent inconsistency here, when one considers the

principles of probability to be more reliable for physical events, but not
human events. It ignores the fact that probability in human events has a
psychological importance. If, on the basis of extensive empirical
observation and intuitive inference, a specific time is adjudged to be
auspicious, it also provides a basis
for psychological confidence for
undertaking an activity which could lead to its fulfilment, where the
fulfilment may be physical or just psychological. But without being drawn
into such a contentious debate, we may focus on another critical point. The
rejection of modern historians of astronomical references in ancient Indian
texts as all ritual, astrology and superstition misses a critical point. One
may reject interpretation of astronomical phenomena, but it is certainly not
scientific to reject physical observation of the phenomena.
The Mahabharata is replete with observations of astronomical events
but are set in considering their bearing on events as omens or indicators of
looming disaster. But the observations are themselves beyond question
and it would be an atrocious travesty to say that Vyasa has fabricated
them. Chapter – 8 has given details of a striking investigation by Dr.
Narahari Achar of such evidence to arrive at compelling conclusions of the
precise dates of several such observations in the Mahabharata.

Chapter – 3 : Speech, Writing and Knowledge

The ancient Seers saw that Knowledge that connected Man with
God must be made available to all mankind and for this purpose they
needed use of the Word. Their deep contemplation took them beyond the
reaches of the eye and the intellect into the realm of intuition, for a
perception of a truth and for a word to describe it, a perception through
sight and sound, which have come to be represented by the words Dhrusti
and Sruti. The ancient Rishis considered sound – specifically the sacred
primordial sound OM, as the first manifestation of the Divine, and several
Seed sounds, the Bija Akshras, from which Mantras bearing special
meaning and power could emanate. Basic sounds were assembled into the
most expressive words into what became the Sanskrit language. The task
was undertaken with deep care and reverence, and this was reflected in the
name Sanskrit that they gave to the language, a word that means “made to
perfection”. And in this new language they embodied the truths that were
revealed to them in their physical and psychic vision, in the poetic form of
Riks or poems with different meters.
Words of a language have necessarily to be comprised of descriptive
nouns assigned to persons, places and things, verbs to represent actions
and adjectives to reflect attributes. Words, also necessarily limited in
number, need to be applied to perceptions and experiences, which were
numerous with new ones constantly accumulating. Words have therefore
be shared, carrying different meanings in respect of different perceptions
and experiences. Words got assigned to and shared by events and
persons on earth, to events and stars in the sky and to the powers and
divinities in the heavens, and to their inter-relationships. The names
Vasishta and Arundati, for instance, referred to a great sage and his wife,
who were later conferred with immortality through identification with the
two important stars in the firmament, who were assigned the same names.
This sage and his wife lived as ideal models of marital felicity and this fact
led to the custom prevailing even today, of newly weds being required to
look at these stars and invoke their blessings and follow their example.
The limited number of words in the language, of course, accounted
for the extensive use and sharing of symbol and metaphor. The difficulty
becomes insurmountable when dealing with the symbolism of rituals. The
sacrificial fire is not easily understood as explained elsewhere, as an
interface, as much physical as spiritual, for the interaction between the
human and the divine. The ritual was clearly and consciously designed
with actions and materials and clothed in words, each of enormous
symbolic and psychological significance, which could not be understood

except through personal instruction by a teacher. It is clearly to be
understood that the ritual is possibly the one single mechanism of
enormous power, that has inscribed the ancient Vedic tradition into the
psyche of the people and preserved it as an oral tradition through the
millenia, through the symbolic language Anyone without a deep insight,
involvement or understanding of the culture of those times would clearly
find it difficult to interpret its language usages. It is this that presented
much of the problems of scholars of later times, in matters of
understanding and interpretation of the Vedas.
Here is a description in the Rig Veda of the first sacrifices that brought the
divine gifts of speech, words and language from their basic beginnings:
Rig Veda : VIII-100-11

The gods produced Vak, the goddess of speech; her do animals of every
kind utter; may she, Vak, the all-gaddening cow, yielding meat and drink,
come to us worthily praised.
A related hymn suggests how choice of words for the language proceeded,
and describes the process to winnowing the barley grain to remove the
chaff of unsuitable words. The following hymn suggests the stage where
the Rishis finalised the words and set them into meters of the Vedic hymns.
The charming metaphor here of the seven noisy birds refer to the 7 meters
in which the hymns were composed and articulated.
Rig Veda : X-71-3

yåOEn vac: pdv£ymayÓtamÓv¢vÓd°¦¢xx¤ p#¢v¾am¯ .

The wise reached the path of speech by sacrifice, they found it centred in
the Rishis: having acquired it they dispersed it in many places; the seven
noisy birds meet together.

The following hymn refers to a first propitiation of the Sadhya divinities,
who are interpreted to refer to the Chando-Abhimanah:, the deities who
preside over the offering of meters; this would suggest the stage of final
approval of the language and use in the Vedic hymns.
Rig Veda : I-164-50

yåOEn yåOmyjÓt dEvaÞta¢n DmaI¢N p#TmaÓyasn¯ .

The gods sacrifice with sacrifice, for such are their first duties; those
mighty ones assembled in heaven, where the Sadhya divinities who are to
be propitiated reside.
Difficulties of understanding the texts were greatly accentuated by
the way their interpretation was handled by the methods of Philology
developed and used by the early scholars. Aurobindo went to the heart of
this problem by looking at the very origins and course of development of
words and language. He pointed out that in their remote origin, words
must have been small in number and entirely reflected a physical context,
and the words must have only gradually acquired added meaning in
descriptive and psychological terms, as may be observed in the early stage
of Sanskrit word usage in the Vedas. A word like “dhenu” may have
originated to specifically represent the cow, but later acquired the more
generic meaning of “nourisher”, and used in different contexts in the Vedic
texts to indicate a nourisher of different things like energies or powers of
the body, the mind or the soul. Also, insofar as a word or a collection of
words whose meanings brought the higher energies and powers into play,
they would thereby seem to acquire the status of Mantras invested with
those very energies and powers. So while a lay person might understand a
word in its literal sense, an initiate would see different metaphoric
meanings and purposes for it in the different contexts of its use.
Aurobindo therefore argued for a fresh rebuilding the science of philology
from a fresh scientific foundation, where word origins and developments
rested on sounder scientific principles. Without such a sound starting
point, the early Western scholars were easily led into gross
misinterpretation through literal understanding. And their reliance on
Sayana’s overly ritualistic interpretation of the Vedas, served largely to

mislead them. The result was that they dismissed what they could not
understand as myth, or just mumbo-jumbo, and in the process, dismissed
the Vedas as a source of history. By what they dismissed, they missed the
truth.
It only in recent years that philologists are getting to look at the
discipline in a more sensitive and scientific way. Historians have also
started to recognize that what was considered as myth and legend in
ancient cultural traditions, really reflected a remembered history, recorded
in the collective psyche of those societies, whether or not recorded
physically in inscriptions on any medium. The new realization has indeed
been forced on them by striking evidence thrown up by archaeological,
astronomical and other investigations in respect of events in ancient myths
and legends of many of the world’s ancient cultures.
One question that is often asked is why there was such an exclusive
dependence on the oral transmission of the Vedic knowledge, to the point
that there is little evidence of effort to develop systems of writing. One
view is that they were considered the sacred preserve of the priestly class
and oral transmission through the class was the best way of maintaining
the integrity and authenticity of that knowledge. It might equally well be
that this was simply seen by the ancient seers and scholars to be both a
necessary and sufficient mechanism for maintaining the rigid mental
discipline on which all spiritual endeavour must rest, and that resort to
writing was not really necessary for this and might indeed detract from
effectiveness of mental disciplines that was needed as the prime requisite.
Indeed the spiritual dimensions of its concepts and the extensive language
symbolism in which they had necessarily to be clothed, made the texts
quite difficult to understand in all their depth, that there was no way in
which they could be understood or even sensed, except by the personal
teaching of the Guru. Even the Guru could take the disciple only up to a
point, and beyond that, merely point to the implications. The only way in
which he could refer to the Highest Truth was with the word “That”. Fuller
understanding could only follow from the teaching by first memorizing the
texts and then deeply reflecting on them, till their full implications were
realized and internalized.
It seems difficult to believe that the ancients who had such a
phenomenal skill of devising the syllabic structure of the fifteen meters that
they developed for articulating the text, could not have developed writing
systems which was a matter of designing a small set of physical symbols
for the letters or syllables. Their design of a large number of Yantras, or
sacred geometric patterns used in worship speaks of their skills of graphic
and symbolic representation. There are textual indicators in the Rig Veda
itself that are suggestive though not explicit, that writing systems may
indeed have been developed at that time, but the Vedic scholars may have

chosen not to avail of them, because it was not considered critical to their
specific teaching objectives and methods. The Rig Verse (RV – X – 71 - 4)
speaks of Speech that is heard and also seen. The Taittiriya Samhita (TS –
V – 2 – 8) speaks of the divine sign (Devalakshmam) written three fold (tryalikhita) that would appear to refer to the OM symbol that is written with
three strokes. The Mahabharata itself records that it was written to Vyasa’s
dictation by the God Ganesha, who used a bit of his tusk as a stylus. One
might ignore what may appear as the super-natural features of this
account, but can one ignore the reference to the act of writing ? And in
terms of incontrovertible physical evidence of writing systems, there are
the extensive seal artifacts of the Indus civilization, coterminous with Vedic
times, which presents several Vedic motifs along with around four hundred
symbols indicative of a script related to the Brahmi script which was the
source all written scripts of later times. Later Upanishads refer to writing
with
references to several aspects of the alphabet. These later
developments could well have been derived from earlier forms. To assert
that something that is not extant did not exist is to deny what was possible
or probable.
Even today, however much we may value the printed word in its
critical role in the dissemination of knowledge, we still find the need to fall
back on the spoken word of the teacher for that bit of insight that helps us
bridge the gaps in our understanding. The superficial criticism of today
that ancient knowledge was held as a close private preserve for
maintaining the privileges of the priestly class may have some truth in the
perversions of socio-economic and political values and institutions of later
times. But this may not be true of the early generations of teachers
brought up in a tradition that clearly obliged them morally, to impart the
knowledge to anyone who came to them, genuinely seeking and thirsting
for knowledge. This knowledge was also not of interest or practical value to
the large mass of people whose needs were only for the skills relevant to
daily physical subsistence and perhaps for some simple rituals for their
spiritual sustenance. Even today, few want to lead a life exclusively
devoted to religion or spirituality and when they do, the need for a guide or
teacher becomes critical. The development of writing systems has indeed,
clearly been related, in those times, and as in all cultures, to the needs and
impetus of commercial activity. These facts only stress the need to retain
an open and generous mindset in making our judgments of the past,
where the demands of living were so different.
The Vedic approach to Knowledge as seen even in the Rig Veda
itself, was holistic in its sweep, all of human experience, all the way from
the secular to the sacred, covering the entire spectrum from the purely
physical to the highest spiritual level. Significant references can be found
in it of all the branches of secular knowledge that must have existed at the
time of the Rig Veda, but got elaborated and documented in later times in

amazing detail and sophistication in what are called the six Vedangas or
limbs of the Vedas : Siksha (Phonetics), Vyakarana (Grammar), Chandas
(Poesy), Nirukta (Etymology), Kalpa (Ritual procedures) and Jyotisha
(Astronomy and Astrology). Of these, the first four relate to linguistics.
The distinguished writer A.L.Basham, writing on the classic work around
the 4th Century BC of Panini, said that his reducing the complex structure
of Sanskrit to a terse set of 4000 rules, was without doubt, “one of the
greatest intellectual achievements of any ancient civilization, and the most
detailed and scientific grammar composed before the 19th Century in any
part of the world”. Panini himself named several ancient works to be the
source of his knowledge.
Here is a hymn that speaks of a surgical procedure to provide an artificial
limb to one whose leg had been cut off in a battle :
Rig Veda : I – 116 - 15

c¢ræO| ¢h vE¢rvaÅCE¢d pNImaja KElÞy p¢rtÀØyayam¯ .
sïaE jHqGamays£| ¢vSlayW DnE stIvEp#ÏyDäOm¯ ..

v¦riv¡cch¦di par²am¡j¡ kh¦lasya paritakmy¡y¡m .
sady§ ja°gh¡m¡yas¢ vi¹al¡yai dhan¦ sartav¦pratyadhattam ..
The foot of Vispala, wife of Khela, was cut off like the wing of a bird in a
battle by night, over a hidden treasure, but you (the Asvins, responding
instantly to prayers) gave her an iron leg that she might be able to walk.

The Sushruta Samhita, the great compendium on medicine and surgery,
attributed to the sage and physician Sushruta, who is placed in the 6th
Century BC must certainly be regarded as a culmination of a long period of
development of the science of Ayurveda, derived from the Atharva Veda
and sometimes described as the fifth Veda. Ayurveda has recorded
astonishingly, that the human body had as many bones and bone-like
components as the number of days in the year : comprised specifically of
312 bones, 32 teeth and 20 nails making a total of 360 !
What would be surprising to many is the intimate bearing the fifth Vedanga,
Kalpa, or Ritual procedures, has not only on the physical principles of
Astronomy and Mathematics but on the individual’s inner life in terms of
psychology and spiritualism. Here is a hymn that outlines the astronomical
and mathematical implications of the Ritual procedures :

Rig Veda : I – 164 – 11

¹adSar| ¢h tÇjray vvI¢tI ck@| p¢r ïam¦ttÞy .
Aa p¤æOa Ag"E ¢mT¤nasaE AæO sçO Sta¢n ¢v||S¢tà tÞT¤: ..

The twelve-spoked wheel of the true (Sun) revolves round the heavens,
never to decay, and (O Agni ) seven hundred and twenty children in pairs,
abide in it.

This is clearly an allegoric description to the never-ending motion in the
sky of the Earth around the Sun, that refers to the unceasing cycle of 360
days in terms of 720 pairs of days and nights, of the 12 months of the year.
This is certainly a pointer, as much to the then existing knowledge of
Astronomy, as to a knowledge of Geometry, and which may have been
picked up or further developed and presented in later times as the full
blown sciences : Astronomy in the Jyotisha Vedanga, or Geometry and
Mathematics in the later Sulba Shastras. It is interesting that many of these
insights have been extensively recognized for their relevance to many of
the insights of modern science. Erwin Schroeder, one of the creators of the
Quantum theory, which transformed all understanding of modern science
and led to the great advances of science and technology, was explicit in
stating that quantum mechanics gave form to the noon-dualist philosophy
of Vedanta.
The psychological and spiritual implications of Ritual procedures are
elaborated elsewhere in another Chapter.
------------------------------------------------

Chapter – 4 : Ritual, Rationality and Spirituality
The Indian tradition always recognized the four human goals, the
Purusharthas, in terms of Artha, or economic well being, Kama, or love and
aesthetic fulfillment, Dharma, or morality, and Moksha, or spiritual
liberation. It is possible that the interests of the individual also tends to
evolve in that order as he advances in age and as his experiences expand.
But the highest value and emphasis was always placed on the last goal, to
the point that spirituality pervaded every facet of Indian life, including all
art and culture.
With the Rig Veda acknowledged as India’s oldest scripture, and
cited as the ultimate authority for all Knowledge, it will be interesting to
see how this text brings knowledge built on an infrastructure of ritual,
rationality and spirituality, and a superstructure from which each of these
three perspectives emerge seamlessly and in astonishing detail.
Ancient Indian Seers recognized a common basic unity and order
underlying both individual and cosmic existence. They were led to place
both subjective and the objective experience into a vast, integrated,
common framework of consciousness, and of physical and psychic
existence, with clear inter-connections and inter-dependencies across
every part of it. The individual and the cosmos and its stellar firmament
were seen as subject to the same vast cycle of Creation-PreservationDissolution within a single vast context, though on different scales of
Space and Time. And it was part of the same vast consciousness that
enabled the individual to understand his place in this vast existence, to
understand how the cosmos stretched from deep within his own mind, into
the far reaches of Space and Time, of Infinity and Eternity. In the Vedic
metaphor, the word Purusha, means the resident of the Pura, the city
represented by the individual’s body, and also refers to the Supreme Spirit
that pervaded the entire cosmos. It is in this vast context that the ancient
Seers set their understanding of existence. It may be significant that the
Seers of the Rig Veda, being the priests of the Puru tribe, may have coined
the word Purusha to stand for man. The word Purusha was then applied the
highest Being from whom all cosmic existence originated. This word has
remained unique to the Vedic vocabulary, in contradistinction to the word
Manushya, or one descended from Manu, the first man, and which got
widely adapted in the Indo-European language family.
The following hymn, significantly called the Purusha Suktha of the Rig
Veda, is a widely regarded and recited in prayer, describing the process of
evolution from the Purusha, the Highest Being, the Macroscopic Man,
into all the forms of cosmic existence.

Purusha is verily all this (the manifest world) and all that is to be; he is also
the lord of immortality for he extends (beyond himself) for the food (of all
the living).
It is important to note the use of two words : ‘Idam’ or ‘This’ to denote this
existence that is bounded by Time and Space, and ‘Tat’ or ‘That’ to denote
that source which is Eternal and Infinite, and from which all existence
originates, and is delimited. This concept comes through beautifully in the
following oft-quoted sloka from the Shukla Yajur Veda :

‘ p¥NImd: p¥NI¢md| p¥NaIÏp¥NIm¤dÅytE

Om ! That is perfect. This too is perfect. From That is This born. Yet That
remains undiminished.
Is this not a Vedic version of the mathematical statement that of
subtraction of no amounts can diminish Infinity !

Here is an affirmation that all different names refer but to the One highest
divinity : that this religion is not poly-theistic, but mono-theistic :

The need of the seeker for the help of a teacher for his first perceptions of
the truth are expressed in the following hymn :

Nama is reverential homage, expressed in the offering homage through the
standing or prostrating before the elder or the teacher with folded hands,
the Namaskara, that we are all familiar with. It symbolizes submission and
reverence.

Reverence be to the potent (the universal gods); I offer them reverence:

An allied word is Sharanam or Sharanagati, or refuge, or surrender, the
ultimate act that expiates all of one’s wrong doing. is a similar word : One
may recall the final message of Krishna in the Gita :

Here is a hymn that suggests how the ancient sages, observing and
meditating on the truth, with the power of Mantras, generated the dawn of
knowledge :

The following prayer to make the Sun visible, is a prayer for enlightenment
with a higher consciousness where the Reality can be realized.

the godly to heaven and the others back to life on earth.

I have heard that there are two paths for gods and ancestors; all this
universe between the paternal (heaven) and maternal (earth) proceeds on
its way by these two paths.
The British Vedicist, Jeanine Miller summed up the profundity of
Vedic thought in the following words :
Vedic thought, especially with regard to meditation and eschatology ,
reveals an unexampled depth of insight into the intricacies of the human
mind, the background philosophy of which was the root of all subsequent
speculations. The hymns do not mark the start of the Vedic cult, they
embody rather the culmination of a culture whose beginnings were already
remote in the eyes of its promoters and to which they constantly looked
back. The layers of thought that may be distinguished – mythological and
philosophical – are steeped in an age-old tradition going back to a distant
past, ever present in the rishis’ mind as the time of their ancestors, the
beneficent patriarchs whose heirloom was their treasure and the
foundation of their civilization”

The Rig Veda is thus clearly an enormous complex of ritual, rational
and spiritual concepts, with each of its hymns admitting of interpretation
from any or all of these perspectives, and different commentators have
emphasized one or other of these. The ritualitic emphasis in the
interpretation of the Vedas was last set by the last ancient Vedic
commentator, Sayana (1315-1389) and it is on this that the first Western
scholars rested their understanding, and that the Western colonists used
to subvert and discredit the Vedic teaching. Specifically, the Yagna or
sacrifice, occupied a position of centrality in the Vedic texts and also in the
vast spread of ritualistic practice amongst the people. The Yagna was also
envisaged in two different contexts. The Griha Yagnas were designed to be
essentially a private activity with observances in homes, on occasions like
births, deaths and marriages, where individual priests might be invited to
conduct them. The Shrauta Yagnas, on the other hand, were major public
occasions, sponsored by rulers or public benefactors for the common
good, and where teams of priests were organized for conducting them.
With this twofold approach it was certainly inevitable that ritual should find
widespread appeal and acceptance, and in particular, become established
among the common people as a way of life because it provided a very
simple and effective basis on which religious practice could get enmeshed
in all their life activities and specially the special occasions when it was
important to invoke divine support or blessing.
But it is as important that the Yagna should be understood, not just
as a physical setting for its mechanical processes, but in its true
psychological, philosophical and sppiritual dimensions as well. And it was
when the Yagna started to so degenered into empty mechanical practices
that later times saw movements for a return to essentials. The movement
even in Vedic times was seen in the development from the Vedas, of the
Upanishads, and later the mass movements of Buddhism and Jainism.
And more recent times this corrective movement was provided by the great
savants like Aurobindo and Swami Dayanand. They explained clearly that
the Vedic teaching refers, not just to the externally manifested divinities
and powers of Nature and the Cosmos, but also representatives of the
same powers that were resident within man himself. The sacrificial altar
and fire, and the priests and the mantras provided the physical interface
that bridged the human and the divine, and the process was moderated by
the holy fire, the god Agni, who provided the exchange mechanism to
receive the human offering and bring back the divine blessing. The word
Yagna, as Aurobindo explained, came from the ultimate root, Ya, to
preserve; from this comes Yaj and its derivative, Yagna, to control; and
other derivatives like Yam, to regulate, Yat, to practice, Yachh, to entreat ,
etc One sees at once the depth and sensitivity of Sanskrit in the range of
nuances that spring from even a single consonant or syllable. The Yagna
was therefore to be understood as much an internal as an external process,
where the Yajamana, the person initiating the external process of reaching

out to the divine, also represented his soul conducting his own internal
spiritual development.
The most perceptive and persuasive view that the Vedas are
essentially
spiritual in content and intent, comes from the Seerphilosopher, Aurobindo as may be seen from his luminous words quoted
below :
“We speak of evolution of Life in Matter, the evolution of Mind in Matter; but
evolution is a word which merely states a phenomenon, without explaining
it. For there seems to be no reason why Life should evolve out of material
elements, or Mind out of living form, unless we accept the Vedantic
solution that Life is already involved in Matter and Mind in Life, because in
essence, Matter is a form of veiled Life., Life a form of veiled
Consciousness. And then there seems to be little objection to a further
step in the series and the admission that mental consciousness may be
only a form and a veil of higher states which are beyond the Mind. In that
case, the unconquerable impulse of man towards God, Light, Bliss,
Freedom, Immortality presents itself in the right place in the chain as
simply the imperative impulse by which Nature is seeking to evolve
beyond Mind ….”

Chapter – 5 : The Vedic People, Kings and Sages
What do we know of those referred to as the Sages who first
articulated the wisdom of the Vedas, the Kings who fostered this wisdom
and the people in whom the Vedas took such deep roots as to be sustained
for millenia? What light does the Rig Veda itself throw on these points ?
The ancient tradition held that several tribes lived in the area now
recognized as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Two of them were
prominent, referred to as the Solar race of the Ikshvakus, and the Lunar
race of the Ailas. Among the descendents of the Ailas. Five tribes became
prominent : the Yadus, the Turvasas, Druhyus, Anus and Purus. This is
indicated in the following hymn of the Rig Veda, set as always, in the
context of the activities of the Vedic Gods :
Rig Veda : I – 108 - 8

y¢dÓd#ag"£ yÑ¤x¤ t¤vISEx¤ ydq d#^/¤Ývn¤x¤ p¥âx¤ ÞT: .

If you, Indra and Agni, be amidst the Yadus, Turrvasus, Dhryus, Anus and
Purus, come hither, O giver of benefits, to drink the Soma offerings.
From among the Purus emerged the Bharata dynasty, named after an
ancient king of that name, and it is the Bharatas that find prominent
reference throughout the Rig Veda. This line of kings, founded by
Devavata, included at a later point of time, Divodasa and Sudas who
played a prominent rule in the consolidation of the dynasty in the land of
the Purus, now clearly identifiable with the Punjab and Haryana as the
Aryan heartland of the Rig Veda. The Rig Veda indeed refers to the Purus
as “Purave Manave jane” or men of ancient stock and even coined a
cognate unique word “Purusha” to stand for “man” as distinct from
“Manushya”, derived as a descendent of the first man, Manu. It is
interesting that while “Purusha”” remained a unique Vedic word, that never
found its way into the common Indo-European linguistic stock, as the word
“Manushya” did, and which perhaps, surfaced later as “Man” in English.
Incidentally one may notice the cognate word “Pura” standing for cities
where men lived and “Purusha” itself also came to signify the divine,
resident within man, and externally sustaining all existence.

The Purus occupy a central position of primacy in the Rig Veda that
virtually identifies them as the Vedic Aryans, and it is from their Rishis that
the Vedas originated. The Rig Veda gives a position of prime importance to
the river Sarasvati and that the lives of the Purus centred around this river
is explicitly stated in the following hymn :
Rig Veda : VII – 96 -2

uBE ytE m¢hna S¤B#E AÓDs£ A¢D¢Xy¢Ót p¥rv: .

Beautiful Saraswati, inasmuch as by your might, you feed the Purus who
dwell your two grassy banks, may you, O protrectress, watch over us :
may you, the friend of the Maruts, bestow riches upon the generous. (the
devotees offering generous oblations).
All non-Purus constituted what are referred to as the Dasas, some friendly
and some hostile to the Purus. While the Purus were centred around
Kurukshetra, sustained by the bounty of the River Sarasvati, the Anus and
Dhruhyus and Anus got established in the West and North West, while the
Yadus and Turvasas settled in South West and East. The Rig Veda has
accounts of wars where the Purus pushed the Anus and Dhruhyus
westward, the latter into and beyond Afghanistan, where they became the
fore-runners of the Avestan religion, which therefore bears a stamp of
remarkable identity with the early Vedic heritage. Below are two maps
reproduced fro Talagheri’s book “The Rig Veda – A Historical Analysis”,
showing the course of the rivers and distribution of the main tribes as
they existed at the time of the Rig Veda

Rivers of the Rig Veda

Tribes of the Rig Veda

As indicated earlier, the Bharata dynasty of the Purus was founded
by Devavata, and one of its later kings, Sudas has a special importance in
the consolidation of the dynasty in the land of the Purus. Here is a specific
reference to a critical battle waged by Sudas against the Anus and
Dhruhyus :

Rig Veda : VII – 18-14

The warriors of the Anus and Dhruhyus, hostile to the pious Sudas,
intending to carry off the cattle, perished to the number of sixty six
thousand, six hundred and sixty, such is the glorious act of Indra.

It is with this group of people, the Purus, and their Kings, of the Bharata
dynasty, the ancient Rishis shared the knowledge and practices of the Rig
Veda. The ten books or Mandalas of the Rig Veda, were composed by ten
families of Rishis, who recited their respective Apti-Suktas, or family
hymns at the sacrifices they conducted, and whose identities are recorded
in the Anu-Kramanis or chapter indexes in the Rig Veda itself. The AptiSuktas and Anu-Kramanis provide the foundation, on which, together with
the enormous wealth of internal detail in the texts themselves, it became
possible for historians like Talageri build a formidable and unprecedented
chronology of the Vedic tradition, The 10 Rishi families
were the
Angirases, Bhrugus, Viswamitras, Vasishtas, Agastyas, Kasyapas, Atris,
Kanvas, Grtsamadas, and the Bharatas, the last being Kings who became
Rishis. While most of the Rishis functioned as the Chief priests of the
Purus, some, the Atris and Kanvas seemed to have reached out to nonPurus and composed hymns called Danastutis in praise of their Kings, who
showered them with gifts. The Rishis were certainly men of remarkable
insight whose hymns appeared mainly to be in praise of the Gods,
portraying their victories over the forces of disorder and evil, and the
victories of Kings over their enemies to be as much, the same handiwork of
the Gods. Yet they also provided a framework for ritualistic practices and
spiritual symbols for a deeper relationship between Man and God. These ar
aspects that are addressed in other Chapters of this book.
----------------------------------------

Chapter 6 : Civilization, Cities and Commerce
The American Historian Will Durant, defined the word Civilization
beautifully and comprehensively in the following words :
“Culture suggests agriculture, bur civilization suggests the city. In one aspect
civilization is the habit of civility; and civility is the refinement that townsmen,
who made the word, thought possible in the ‘civitas’ or city. For in the city are
gathered, rightly or wrongly, the wealth and brains produced in the
countryside; in the city invention and industry multiply comforts, luxuries and
leisure; in the city, traders meet and barter goods and ideas; in the crossfertilization of minds at the crossroads of trade, intelligence is sharpened and
stimulated to creative power. In the city some men are set aside from the
making of material things, and produce science and philosophy, literature and
art. Civilization begins in the peasant’s hut but it comes to flower only in the
towns”
The ancient texts sets the origin of the Indic Civilization in the Sapta-Sindhu,
the Land of the Seven Rivers, the large swath across Northern India, watered
by the Indus and Ganges and their main tributaries, all together, seven in
number. The Vedas themselves, as detailed in Chapter – 5, originated in the
area of the Kurukshetra area of modern Haryana, but their influence went on to
spread to a vast area to constitute the Indic Civilization, and ultimately
capture the minds and hearts of people all over India with a hold of power and
depth that remain intact today. And if as Will Durant says, civilization is
characterized by the spread of cities, here is one of several hymns in the Rig
Veda that refers to a large number of cities of this civilization where its
influence must obviously have been present :
RV – VII – 3 - 7

yTa v: Þvahag"yE daSEm pr£La¢BD¦Itv¢ìà hÛyW: .

When we present to you, Agni, the sacred offering along with oblations
mixed with milk and butter, then protect us, Agni, with those vast
unbounded, innumerable golden cities.

It will be then apparent that the Indic civilization must have covered the vast
advanced cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro on the West, which flowered
during Vedic times, under the life-giving sustenance of the mighty Sarasvati
river, but which later disappeared along with that river in the geological and
ecological upheavals towards 1800 BC.
Archeological excavations and later Satellite Imaging have yielded a
phenomenal amount of evidence not only for the existence and course and
canal network of the Sarasvati river, but of the existence of well developed
cities at Harappa and Mohenjodaro, and several other locations in the Indus –
Sarasvati basin. The evidence shows brick buildings laid out on well planned
streets with water supply and drainage networks, which could not have been
executed without a deep knowledge of geometry and skills of engineering.
There was an existence of a wide range of arts and crafts involving working
with cotton and metal. The Sulba Sutras of the Baudhayana school dedicated
to the geometry and design of sacrificial symbols, carries a detailed design of
the spoked wheel. This is a frequent motif among seals found in Harappa,
which also carry inscriptions indicating use of writing systems, and
suggesting use in trade and commerce, clearly point to the urban dimensions
of the Indic civilization.
Here is a hymn that indicates the reach of the Indic civilization right up to the
western coastline of India and points to an established environment of travel
in large ocean-going boats, obviously manned by large numbers of sailors,
that would indicate an involvement in maritime commerce.
RV – I – 116 - 5

This exploit you achieved, Asvins, in the ocean, where there is nothing to

When read with evidence in distant places like Egypt, Pheonicia, Babylon
and Asia Minor, seen in records, seals, artifacts and linguistic and
knowledge exchanges originating from the Indus civilization and the
western coast of India, it is clear that there were extensive trade contacts in
Vedic times both by land and by sea, with these distant lands. There is
evidence of trading in 9755 BC by King Hiram of Tyre (Pheonicia) with India

through the port of Ophir near modern Mumbai. This port also carried the
name Supara, a Sanskrit word indicative of the Vedic influence in that
region before 1000 BC. Aryan elements were known to have migrated to Sri
Lanka before the time of Buddha (563 BC). The Brahmi alphabet is seen in
Indonesia in the 3rd Century BC. And Harappan dated to 2400 BC have been
found in ancient Mesopotamia sites indicating contacts between the
Harappa, Sumer and Akkadia civilizations, which had a special interest in
importing timber from India. And as will be seen in Chapter – 8, there is
clear evidence of the knowledge of these distant cultures of Astronomy
and mathematics having originated from the Indic civilization.
----------------------------------------------------

Chapter – 7 : Archaeology & Support Sciences
Bal Gangadhar Tilak (1856-1920), was one of the great early leaders
of India’s freedom struggle, revered to this day as the Loka Manya, the
beloved of the people. He was also a Sanskrit scholar of great erudition
who was one of the first to look into the Vedas for their historical content.
And as indicated in Chapter – 9, he put forward the astronomical
references in the Rig Veda as incontrovertible evidence of such historical
value. He did not confine himself to the main texts of the principal Vedas,
but examined a wide range of texts like the Brahmanas, the Upanishads,
the Puranas, and even the Iranian texts, without the biases of the
establishment that considered them as legends and myths and not history.
He also cast out much further and studied other archaeological, geological
and ecological disciplines to find objective support for his thesis.
Archeology determined the chronology of civilizations in terms of
the Paleolithic, Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages, with reference to artifacts
found at surface levels of the earth. Geology looked at chronology of the
earth itself in terms of the Primary, Secondary, Tertiary and Quarternary
Ages. The last was further marked by Pleistocene or Glacial period,
followed by the Post Glacial period, which saw large continental stretches
of the earth submerged in Ice, followed by periods emerging out of the ice
cover. The Pleistocene Age also saw vast geological upheavals
accompanied by vast redistribution of land and water leading to the
formation of continents and oceans as we know them.
All these geological changes had their inevitable impact on
ecological changes, rendering large land areas hospitable or inhospitable
in terms of climate for the purpose of human habitation. And it is from
these studies that Tilak concluded that at one time the Polar regions must
have had a milder climate that made them habitable. In such a case the
long and beautiful dawns and the Aurora Borealis must have left an
indelible impression of wonder and awe in the inhabitants who could have
been the ancestors of the Vedic Aryans. And when ultimately when these
people migrated into India, they must inevitably carried these memories of
the long dawns and transmitted down to their later generations to find a
place the Vedic records as indicated In Chapter – 9
At this point we need only to remind ourselves that the vast
geological upheavals and their ecological consequences, has left us with a
trail of archeological evidence of several ancient civilizations coming to an
end by drought, or by riverine systems consumed by the earth or coastal
cities consumed by the sea. In the case of India, we have the examples of
the ancient tradition of the loss to the sea of the cities of the First and

Second Tamil Sangam in the South, or the city of Dvaraka city around
1400 BC

The Sarasvati river occupies a position of central importance in the Rig
Veda as the biggest and most important of the Sapta-Sindhu, the land of
the Seven Rivers sustained by the vast area of the basins of the Indus and
Ganges. The ‘Sapta Sindhu’ refers to the rivers Saraswati, Satadru (Sutlej), Vipasa
(Beas), Asikni Chenab), Parosni (Ravi), Vitasta (Jhelum) and Sindhu (Indus). Among these,
the Saraswati and the Sindhu were major rivers that flowed from the mountains right up to
the sea.

One of the several hymns in the Rig Veda refer to the Sarasvati as below :
Rig Veda VII- 95 - 02

ekacEtÏsrÞvt£ nd£na| S¤¢cyIt£ ¢g¢r×y Aa sm¤d#at¯ .
rayàEtÓt£ B¤vnÞy B¥rEG¦It| praE Ñ¤Ñ¤hE nah¤xay ..

r¡ya¹c¦tant¢ bhuvanasya bh£r¦rgh¤ta par§ duduh¦ n¡huº¡ya ..
Saraswati, the chief and pure of rivers, flowing from the mountains to the
ocean, understood the request of Nahusha for distributing wealth for many
beings by providing milk and water.
The phrase ‘milk and water’ is akin to the phrase ‘milk and honey’, we now
use to describe prosperous lands.
Archeology :
The existence of the Saraswathi, now no longer existing, and for long
considered by historians to be a myth, has now been clearly established
by surface archaeological excavations, as a major river system that
originated, along with the Indus and its tributaries in the Himalayan
glaciers and terminated in the Arabian Sea off the Kathiawar coast of
Gujarat, and supporting what is now established as the major Harappa –
Saraswathi civilization – see Sapta-Sindhu River Map in Chapter – 5

Satellite Imaging :
The methods of Archeology of surface excavations have received a great
boost after the development in recent years of the Remote Sensing
technology by photography fro satellites. Satellite images have now
confirmed the existence of the extinct Sarasvati River with striking details
of its course and of habitations that were supported by the river basin.
The following is one such satellite image along with a reconstruction of a
geographical outline map by its side :

The satellite image on the left is drawn in the map on the right, showing the
Indus River in blue, the dry Sarasvati River basin in green and archaeological
sites as black dots.
The river also binds the Rigvedic culture and the Sarasvati-Sindhu
civilization since the Sarasvati river is the locus of over 1200 ancient
archaeological settlements contiguous to the Rigvedic domain.
Geology & Glacio-geology :
Geology and Glacio-geology have methods that are able to throw light on
the dating and chronology of changes in the structures of earth formations
and ice-formations over periods on an millenial scale. An important
glaciological dating tool is the fact that each glacier can supply waters into
a major stream like the Ganga for a period of 10,000 years. The conclusions
from these earth science perspectives are that when the Sarasvati river

was in its mighy flow, it had carried the glacier waters which are now
carried by S’atadru and Yamuna.
Geological and Glaciological studies have shown the sequential history of
the Sarasvati river through the following stages : (1) streams were flowing
through Markanda river; (2) the streams migrated towards the Drishadvati
river; (3) Drishadvati river migrated eastwards, linked up with Chambal
which captured the Tons river stream flowing into Sarasvati river at
PaontaSaheb in Himachal Pradesh; (4) S’atadru river stream which had
joined Sarasvati river at Shatrana migrated westwards with a 90-degree
turn at Ropar and ultimately became a tributary of the Sindhu river. After
the rise of the Himalayas, S’atadru became the anchorage river of
Sarasvati; what is now called Yamuna joined the Sarasvati river at
PaontaSaheb. Ganga which had emerged from Gangotri received Chambal
(now Yamuna) as its tributary at Prayag, Allahabad. Glaciological studies
have also showed the existence of quartzite and metamorphic rocks in
Paonta Doon valley and near Ad Badri in Siwalik ranges attesting to the
existence of the mighty Vedic Sarasvati river which had brought in these
signature rocks.
Isotope Analysis :
This is a powerful analytical tool based upon a measurement of the
residues within ancient artifacts, of isotopes of several elements like
carbon, hydrogen, which have well-defined periods of decay called the
half-life periods.
Carbon dating based on the C-14 isotope of carbon has established the
antiquity of the Ganeshwar mines in Rajasthan which provided the mineral
sources and resulted in artifacts of the bronze age of the Harappa
civilization. Tritium (an isotope of Hydrogen ) analysis of deep water
samples taken by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, has
provided a broad spectrum dating for the waters of the Sarasvati river now
found as groundwater sanctuaries and aquifers. The age of these waters
range from 4000 to 8000 years Before Present (B.P.).
Cotton that has been so dated to 2500 BC, possibly originating from India
has been found in Peru. There is extensive evidence in Peru of sea-borne
contact with India and of the extensive prevalence of Sanskritic names and
Vedic symbols, that would point
to a considerable cultural and
commercial exchange exchanges with India. The fact that the Hindus
were capable of sailing to far off countries like Mexico and Peru is cited in
an official publication of the Mexican Foreign Office. “Those who first
arrived on the continent later to be known as America were groups of men
driven by that mighty current that set out from India towards the east: An
U. S. Ambassador Miles Poindexter states in his book, “ ….primitive Aryan

words and people came to America especially from Indo-Arya by the island
chains of Polynesia. The very name of the boat in Mexico is a South Indian
(Tamil) word : Catamaran”
A study of the origin of cotton in India presents some interesting facts.
The traditional Western bias that all of Indian history arose from the Aryan
Invasion of India from the West, has held that cotton was earlier unknown
in India and it was first known in Sumeria. The Rig Veda knows of fabrics
and weaving but does not specify cotton or even have a word for it. The
first word for it was Karpasa, used in the later Sutras, but the Harappa
civilization that is coterminous with the Sutras and also coterminous with,
if not earlier than the Sumerian civilization has thrown up clear evidence of
the use of cotton and of weaving of cotton fabrics. Sumeria had contacts
with Harappa and its word for cotton was Kapazum, suggesting a
Harappan origin, for the word, if not the material.
The are similar theories of the Aryan Invasion protoganists that and the
horse was not known in India and came from the West. When horse bones
were found in the Harappa excavations to show that the horse was known
much earlier in India, one diehard ‘Invasionist’ historian went as far as to
suggest that what was discovered were bones of asses. It could be well
said that this historian made history by making an ass of himself.
Metallurgical Analysis :
Sophisticated methods have been developed to derive dating chronologies
from metal artifacts of gold, silver, bronze and iron. These methods based
on determining the purity levels of the metallic elements as progressing
through time, provide indicators of the progress of the old societies in the
sophistication of the technologies they used. Typically one can observe a
progression in the refining of gold and the emergence of a clear separate
identity and word for silver. This exemplifies how vocabularies that are
shared at an earlier point of time expand as clear, separate identities
emerge. To say that silver did not exist because the Rig Veda had a word
for gold but not silver is a typical example of interpretation without the
sensitivity that is called for.
Computer Technology :
A final word on one of the most powerful technologies that have become
available today : Computer Technology. Two typical illustrations of its
power would suffice here. Take the word Karpasa for cotton referred to
earlier. How easy is it to check with certainty, whether and how often the
word figures in the vast corpus of Vedic texts. To do it manually is a
formidable task. But with the computer it becomes very fast and very
reliable. Today inexpensive hardware and software are available that

enable us to locate and count the occurrences of any letter or syllable or
word or phrase in any text of any size in a matter of minutes or seconds.
Surely this opens up a whole new world of analytical capability for
linguistic analysis that can throw open vast new perspectives in which our
ancient texts can be viewed and analysed. A second example of the
tremendous analytical power we may derive from the computer may be
seen in Dr. Achar’s dating the Mahabharata War, described in Chapter - 9

------------------------------------

Chapter – 8 : Astronomy & Mathematics
Every ancient culture, whether Babylonian, Grecian, Mayan or Indian,
shows abundant evidence of the deep interest of the people in the Planets,
Stars and firmament, prompting not only deep religious and spiritual
impulses, but also the practical implications of that knowledge, in terms of
the day and night rhythms of daily life, the seasons and their relationship
to agriculture, and the guidance they provided for traversing the oceans
and desert to distant lands to establish trade, commerce, and exchange of
vocabulary, knowledge and skills. The world would appear to have been
more civilized and inter-connected, over 5000 years ago, than Europe may
have been 500 years ago.
The ancient Seers always set all human thoughts and actions in a
vast cosmic context of human-divine interaction. The ritual sacrifice
symbolized this interaction in an amazing depth of detail, often involving
an advanced knowledge of Astronomy and Mathematics. Many other
hymns carry references to the distribution of the 27 stellar constellations
over the 12 spans constituting the ecliptic and the relative motion of the
Sun, Moon and Earth,, accounting for the months, seasons, the solstices,
equinoxes and the eclipses. This enabled the Seers to settle on the right
seasons and times for the conduct of the ritual sacrifices.
There is a reference in the following hymn of Rudra drinking the water that
came of a process of vast churning,
RV – X – 136 - 7

vay¤rÞma upamÓT¢Ïpn¢¾ Þma k[n°ma
°ma .
kES£ ¢vxÞy paæOEN yÑ¤d#ENa¢pbÏsh ..
v¡yurasm¡ up¡manthatpinaº·i sm¡ kunannam¡ .
k¦¹¢ viºasya p¡tr¦²a yadudr¦²¡pibatsaha ..
Vayu churned for him, the inflexible thunder ground it, when the radiant
Sun with Rudra, Drank The water with his cup.

It has been suggested that this hymn has a bearing on one of the
most vivid stories of Indian mythology, narrated in the Mahabharata, of Siva
drinking the poison thrown up by the churning of the oceans for obtaining the
nectar of immortality. This story is summarized here because of its unusual
allegoric reference to an understanding of ancient astronomy. The story has it
that the gods and the demons churned the cosmic ocean using the sacred
mountain Mandara as a churning stick and the holy serpent Vasuki as a rope,
in a race to retrieve the Amrita, the nectar of immortality. When the churning
threw up a vast poison that threatened the world, Siva came to the rescue and
swallowed the poison, turning his throat and neck blue in colour, an attribute
that gave Siva the name Neelakanta, or one with a blue neck. The churning
later brought up milk, then produced the Moon and then the Sun. Finally when
finally the nectar came up in a white vessel, it was immediately grabbed by the
demons. Before they could consume it, however, they were diverted by
Vishnu, who appeared before them as the beautiful enchantress, Mohini, who
seized the opportunity of their distraction, to seize the nectar vessel and pass
it on to the gods, who promptly consumed it to ensure their immortality.
There are several points of significance to this great story. First,
Siva’s drinking the poison, to avert ecological disaster and maintain rta, the
cosmos order. One wonders whether it is some divine impulse like this, that
expresses the contemporary world’s drive to save the planet from ecological
disaster. The emergence of milk, the moon and sun, are expressions of the
evolution of the cosmos, with the milk representing the Milky Way. The gods
and demons correspond to the stars of the Northern and Southern celestial
hemispheres. The Mandara is the polar axis of rotation of the earth and
universe. The churning with the serpent rope represents the Sun’s movement,
relative to the earth, along the ecliptic, that marks the movement of both
terrestrial and cosmic time. These movements of the Sun are seen to arise
from the rotation of the earth around its own axis, which accounts for the day
and night sequence of 24 hours. The revolution of the earth around the Sun
accounts for 365 days of the year, with the skewed rotation of the earth
accounting for the apparent North-South shift of the Sun relative to the earth
accounting for the terrestrial phenomena of seasons, the two solstices and the
two equinoxes. At the same time a slower circular shift in the axis of rotation
of the earth itself, results in an apparent shift of the Sun, relative to the earth,
called precession. This shift of the Sun is along the 12 Signs of the Zodiac,
taking about 2160 years to traverse each of them, and covering the full Zodiac
in 25920 years, which is said to constitute the cosmic Solar Year. The cosmic
year is clearly reflected in the Yuga chronology of the ancients described in
Chapter - 2. These last mentioned shifts of the Sun across each Sign of the
Zodiac are assessed by the ancients as shifts in the state of order in the
cosmos, marked by a short period of disorder and ultimate restoration of the
old state of order, which are also reflected in similar disorders on earth, and
again symbolized by the intervention of Siva for upholding order in both
heaven and earth.

These ancient details of astronomical phenomena in all their
astonishing detail and accuracy have largely been confirmed by modern
knowledge. It will also be now clear from the above account that if such a
range and depth of knowledge had to be compiled and preserved for the
benefit of humanity for all time to come, the ancient Seers chose to set
brief references to them in verse in the Vedas in a framework of myth,
allegory and ritual, and to leave it to future generations of teachers for
further elaboration and dissemination.
Such elaboration and dissemination did indeed follow in later times
when the brevity and imagery of the Vedas was considered inadequate.
Astronomy flowered in fuller and more explicit and practical detail in the
Vedangajyotisha, one of the Vedangas or limbs of the Vedas, in the
famous Aryabhatiyam of Aryabhata (476 AD), and the Panchasiddhanta
compiled by Varahamihira (505 AD), which included the Suryasiddhanta, of
which, a version revised around 1000 AD continues to be the most widely
astronomy text to this day.
As stated earlier, other ancient cultures possessed a considerable
knowledge of astronomy reflected in their remarkably accurate calendars
and in the design of their monuments like the Mayan temples or Egyptian
pyramids. In later times astronomers started to compute the chronology of
ancient historical events from references in the related texts, to the Sun’s
precession positions in the Zodiac. One early example cited earlier in the
Introduction is the dating of the Great Biblical Flood by the famous
astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571- 1630). In our own day, determination of
chronology of ancient Indian texts through astronomical evidence was
slow in coming as Western historians had already prejudged the texts as
irrelevant as sources of history, and it was left largely to Indian scholars
led by Bal Gangadhar Tilak to seriously take up this challenge. It is no
surprise that today Indians who have mastered modern science but remain
strongly rooted in Indian tradition have started to make great contributions
in this area of study. Many of them have had the benefit of computer
programmes to handle all the related computation and analysis and
quickly access vast tables of astronomical data covering periods of 10000
years or more. A striking example today is seen in the work of Dr
B.N.Narahari Achar, Professor of Physics, University of Memphis, TN-USA
he took note of the following reference to the near total solar eclipse
recorded in the Rig Veda 5:40:5, associated with the Rishi Atri :

This is translated as below :
When you Oh Sun, were darkened by the demon Svabhanu (another name
for Rahu), the worlds were bewildered with its beings not knowing where
they were. (The same material is expanded in Kaushitiki or Sankhyayana
Brahmana. 24.4.). Dr Achar ahs been able to date this eclipse at the 14th
October, 3067 BC.
The Mahabharata is replete with such observations of astronomical
events but are often set in descriptions of them as omens or indicators of
looming disaster. But whatever the inferences that might be drawn from
the, the physical observations are themselves beyond question and it
would be an atrocious travesty to say that they are a fiction fabricated by
Vyasa. Putting together the evidence of all these events together for
internal consistence and corroboration Dr. Achar has been able to arrive at
compelling conclusions for the precise dates of several such events,,
including the date of the 22nd November, 3067 BC for the start of the
Mahabharata war, the pivotal marker for all of Vedic chronology.
The construction of the fire altar of the Vedic ritual sacrifices involve
an astonishing depth of knowledge of geometry and mathematics. These
technical principles are set out in the Sulba Sutras that form part of the
Srauta or ritualistic part of the Kalpa Sutras, that in turn, form important
auxiliary texts of the Vedas and are generally placed in the post-Vedic
period, 3100 to 2000 BC. The pioneering and far-reaching work of the
American scholar and mathematician, A.Seidenberg, based on a rigorous
technical analysis of the mathematical knowledge of ancient Pythagoran
Geometry and Old Babylonia, generally placed around 1700 BC are clearly
anticipated far earlier by the mathematics seen in, and could possibly be
traceable back to the Sulba Sutras considering their contacts with India of
those times. A astronomical reference in the Sulba Sutras
of the
Asvalayana school, to the star Alpha-Draconus being the Pole Star of that
time, would place its chronology to between 3100 to 2600 BC, and this
would lend considerable support to the general consensus that set the
dating of the compilation of the Vedas by Vyasa and the Mahabharata War
around 3100 BC or earlier.

Chapter – 9 : History, Legend and Myth
The contribution of the early Western scholars to understand and
document the ancient texts of Indian tradition was certainly impressive.
And it certainly caught the attention and imagination of some of the
greatest Western minds, some of whose responses are reproduced in the
Annexure. But it also left behind an unfortunate and strong legacy,
persisting to this day, of ignoring those texts as possible sources of
history, and of providing their own version of ancient Indian history
resting on a theory of an Aryan invasion from the West. Their formulations
sprang from a Euro-Centric mindset that was convinced that there could be
no more ancient and advanced civilization than the Graeco-Roman, from
whom they were themselves descended, Of course this view was contested
by scholars in their own day who knew that the Greeks themselves
acknowledged a debt to more ancient civilizations like Egypt. One French
savant of that time, Rene Guenon went on to describe the Euro-centric
mind-set as “unable to cross the Mediterranean” Nevertheless that
mindset, led by scholars like Max Muller, did prevail and left a warped
legacy that continues to haunt us to this day.
The central failure of this legacy was the inability to understand the
formidable Sanskrit complex of symbol, metaphor, allegory, paradox,
legend and myth that characterized the Vedic text corpus. Their simple
solution was to dismiss it all as irrelevant to historical purpose and nothing
more than a primitive ritual ridden mass of superstition. And this view was
widely disseminated by embedding it in the educational system that the
British established in India. It was left to scholars of later generations both
in India and abroad to bring a more sensitive and sophisticated
understanding to bear on the Vedic texts in the light of big advances in
diverse branches of knowledge like linguistics, philology, psychology as
also powerful analytical tools of science and technology that became
available to disciplines like archaeology, geology, ecology, physics,
chemistry, astronomy etc.
One of the first breakthroughs came from the understanding of
ritual. Here it was seen that the symbology and vocabulary of the ritual
represented a whole new world-view of human experience – one where
the sacrifice was seen as an interface and a medium of interchange
between the individual and the cosmos. At an external, and physical level,
the sacred fire received the prayerful offerings and gratitude of the
individual to the gods and returning from the gods with the blessings of
rain and food and the needs of living. At an internal and spiritual level, it
was a surrender of the self-centred life in exchange for a god-centred
existence. How could all these activities be ever expressed except by
symbol and word, where meaning was embedded in the mystery of ritual,

legend and myth. had to be implicit, could never be explicit. This was
clearly an environment that a Western mind-set could never understand
unless that mind-set placed its judgments in suspense. It would be
interesting to note that the ancient texts made extensive use of the word
g¤/m¯, or ‘secret’ to describe its inner teachings which really meant that they
they rested on concepts that could never, if ever, be comprehended by the
normal human mind.
It has been left to a new generation of scholars, both Western and Indian to
bring a new mind-set to the understanding of the Vedas, and this has
indeed unleashed an astonishing range of new insights. One of the earliest
of modern Indian scholars to boldly assert that history could be built from
the internal evidence of the Vedas themselves was Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
Though he was better known as of one of the great early leaders of the
Indian freedom struggle, he was no less a scholar of the highest
accomplishment who made a remarkably insightful of the Vedic texts to
extract from them a surprising volume of historical information. The
following is one example :

Rig Veda VII – 76 - 3
tan£dha
tan£dha¢n bh¤laÓyasÓya p#ac£nm¤¢dta s¥yIÞy .

punaryat¢va ..
Many are the days that have dawned before rising of the sun, on which, you
Ushas, have been beheld like a wife repairing to inconstant husband, and
not like one deserting him.
The Rig Veda has a large number of hymns like the one above, addressed
to Ushas, the Goddess of Dawn. The great scholar, A.A.Macdonell
considered Ushas to be the most graceful creation of Vedic poetry, and
that there was no more charming figure than her in the descriptive religious
lyrics of any other culture. This hymn talks of a prolonged dawn lasting
many days, before the rising of the sun. This is beyond doubt, a reference
to a phenomenon that could occur in only one unique geographical setting,

viz. the Polar region. How could such a vivid description find a place in the
Rig Veda ? Tilak gave the remarkable answer : that it is a record from the
memory of a race that must have originated in the Polar Region.
Marshalling an impressive array of other connected references in the Vedic
texts, together with ecological evidence that the Polar regions must have
had, at one time, a milder climate that supported habitation, Tilak built a
remarkable thesis that the Aryans must have originated from there and
later, when the climate became inhospitable, migrated southwards till they
found their final home in India. His thesis, despite its compelling reasoning,
and given his nationalistic bearings, did not suit the British ruler, and was
therefore officially ignored and excluded from all public attention. There is
little doubt however, that Tilak’s opposition to British rule must have been
fuelled, not only by his own nationalistic fervour, but also by a sense of
affront from the scant respect the British showed to the Vedic tradition.
Even Max Muller respected Tilak’s views and held him in esteem to the
point of personally prevailing on the British rulers to release him from
prison where he was confined due to his political activities. (A fact
confirmed by Tilak himself). Much as Muller respected Tilak, he was
himself far too committed to his own Aryan Invasion theory to be able to
accept Tilak’s views.
Tilak did not confine himself to the main texts of the principal Vedas,
but examined a wide range of texts like the Brahmanas, the Upanishads,
the Puranas, and even the Iranian texts, without the biases of the
establishment that considered them as legends and myths and not history.
He also cast out much further and studied other archaeological, geological
and ecological disciplines to find objective support for his thesis.
Archeology determined the chronology of civilizations in terms of the
Paleolithic, Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages, with reference to artifacts
found at surface levels of the earth. Geology looked at chronology of the
earth in terms of the Primary, Secondary, Tertiary and Quarternary Ages.
The last was further marked by Pleistocene or Glacial period, followed by
the Post Glacial period, which saw large continental stretches of the earth
submerged in Ice, followed by periods emerging out of the ice cover. The
Pleistocene Age also saw vast geological upheavals accompanied by vast
redistribution of land and water leading on to the formation of continents
and oceans as we know them. All these geological changes had their
inevitable impact on ecological changes, rendering large land areas
hospitable or inhospitable in terms of climate for the purpose of human
habitation. And it is from these studies that Tilak concluded that at one
time the Polar regions must have had a milder climate that made them
habitable. In such a case the long and beautiful dawns and the Aurora
Borealis must have left an indelible impression of wonder and awe in the
inhabitants and these memories must inevitably have been transmitted to
their later generations into the records of Vedic tradition. And we may also
remind ourselves that the vast geological upheavals and their ecological

consequences, has left us with a trail of archeological evidence of the
ancient civilizations ended by drought, riverine systems consumed by the
earth and coastal cities lost to the sea.
It would therefore not be surprising that in the profound influence of
Tilak’s school of thinking has resurfaced in later years, though with
changed perspectives, but nowhere more striking than in the work of the
brilliant Indian historian of our own times : Shrikant Talageri. This scholar
has constructed a remarkable history from the Rig Veda and the Puranas
where he has thrown up a completely new scenario for the history of the
Vedic times. Not resting merely with a complete refutation of the Aryan
Invasion Theory and its foundation on the Western origin of the IndoEuropean languages, he has virtually reversed the direction of the West to
East movement of that view of history.
He has now presented a compelling body of internal evidence of the
Vedic corpus through an interpretation of those texts of a sophisticated
level not seen from scholars so far, and external evidence of the spread of
Vedic ideas, language constructs, and symbols and artefacts westwards
from India, through Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Asia Minor, Egypt and Greece,
all the way to England, He begins with building a logical internal
chronology for the 10 Mandalas of the Rig Veda, based on the identity of
their Seer authors, as recorded in their own Anu-kramanis, or internal
author indices. He then takes the precaution of starting with references in
the Rig Veda, being the oldest text and linking them to clear internal crossreferences to the same events in a wide range of later texts, for
corroboration. Starting with names of rivers, something that is a stable and
reliable element in tradition, he finds reference to the Jahnavi (or Ganga)
occuring only in the earliest Mandalas, a reference to the Sindhu (or Indus)
only in the end Mandalas, and a concentration of all the names of the
Saraswati and the five rivers of the Punjab in the intervening Mandalas.
This leads him to the strong inference of the Vedic origins in the Ganga
region of the U.P, its spread and consolidation in the region of Punjab and
Haryana and ending in the west at the Indus. He then goes on to a similar
analysis of names of places and events, including local wars against tribes
and groups hostile to the Vedic values, which led to the migration of such
discordant elements towards the west and south towards Gujarat and
Maharashtra and through the north-West to Afghanistan, Iran and beyond
to Europe, thus accounting for the common strands of the family of IndoEuropean languages. Talageri’s studies, resting mainly of an incisive
linguistic analysis and understanding of the Vedic corpus, has provided a
profound complementarity to the other studies that are based on the
Science-based disciplines, and has all but marked the end of the old Aryan
Invasion Theory and its attendant Indo—European Language Theory for the
founding of the Vedic civilization. In its place he has provided a new
cohesive and logical picture of the Vedic Civilization being entirely

indigenous to India, and also as a source of much of Vedic knowledge and
tradition that contributed much to the later civilizations of Persia,
Babylonia, Egypt and Greece.
It would be informative to look at a typical example of Talageri’s
methodology to show its incisive and convincing originality :

May the three Goddesses, Sarasvati, perfecting our understanding, the
divine Ila, and all-impressive Bharati, having come to our dwelling, protect
this faultless rite offered for our welfare.
These verses are a clear reference to the three places, described as
the holiest on earth, and sanctified by Sarasvati, Ila and Bharati,
goddesses, represented in the region by three rivers of the same name and
prominently referred to in the Rig Veda. These locations are corroborated
in the Mahabharata. The river Saraswati does not exist today, but tradition
associates it with the Triveni Sangam at Allahabad and Archeological
evidence has established its existence and alignment beyond doubt. And
even more importantly, the Researches of a brilliant historian, The brilliant
research of the historian M.L.Bhargava, has identified the Ila location with
the present day Shergadh and the Bharati location with Kopar in
Kurukshetra, where worship of these goddesses is maintained till the
preset day. And the reader will be able to relate these riverine systems in

the map below provided by Talageri in his book, “The Rig Veda – A
Historical Analysis”
Talageri’s raises a more fundamental question : if the oldest Rig Veda and
the other later texts drew from the same accumulated stock-pile of ancient
memories, vividly recalled by contemporary generations as a living
tradition, why should the reliability test rest on the Rig Veda alone ? Why
can’t evidence be drawn equally from later texts as well, provided the
evidence was corroborated across different texts, notwithstanding their
relative chronology ? Why indeed should we discriminate between history,
legend and myth as long it was possible to get cohesive, sensible and
corroborated findings ? The difficulty in the case of legend and myth could
be that we are still unable to see beyond their metaphors, analogies and
linguistic quirks and make out their true sense, but then for the inability of
scholars to understand, should they be discounted and dismissed ? After
all, later studies were able to discover substance in Moses leading his
people across the Sea of Reeds, or in the existence of Troy, stories that
were long held as myths. Myth, as explained by the British Vedicist,
Jeanine Miller is “not merely an interesting made-up story, but a pictograph
of great evocative power that is intended to connect us to the reality which
it purports to image”. In respect of legends and myths therefore, where
knowledge is lacking, clearly we need to suspend judgment.

---------------------------------------

Chapter – 10 : Past, Present and Future
As we in India today look back and discover these treasures that
we have inherited from our remote past, and also at the same time look at
our situation today with teeming millions steeped in ignorance, hunger,
poverty, disease, distress and conflict, we inevitably ask the question as to
where we are heading. Religion still remains widespread and deep seated
in the psyche of the people, but considerably overshadowed by ritual and
superstition, with the educated class getting increasingly distanced from
the higher knowledge and values that we have inherited from the past.
Scholarship today, under Western influence, seeks the truth outside in the
powers of nature, in a vast pursuit of materialistic values, rather than
searching within oneself where the powers of true cognition reside. This
led Swami Vivekananda to posing a basic challenge to a world audience in
the USA in 1893 in words of thundering eloquence :
“Shall India die ? Then from the world all spirituality will be
extinct, all sweet-souled sympathy for religion will be extinct, all ideality
will be extinct; and in its pace will reign the duality of lust and luxury as
the male and female dieties, with money as its priest, fraud, force and
competition its ceremonies, and the human soul its sacrifice. Such a thing
can never be”.
Surely Vivekananda was not expressing a hope but asserting a
truth. And the truth is that the materialist values of Science of the West are
yielding, as is they surely must, to the spiritual values of the Knowledge
of the East. A great succession of scholars from the West – the most
distinguished names in the fields of History, Literature, Linguistics,
Religion, Philosophy, Psychology and even all branches of Science, have
helped in overcoming the biases and limited mindsets of earlier scholars,
and are increasingly discovering and articulating the deeper insights and
universal values that the ancient Indian texts contain. Not only are Hindu
temples and ashrams
coming up in Western cities, but spiritual
movements like the Krishna-consciousness and disciplines like Yoga and
Ayurveda are getting an enormous world following. The methods of
Science are being pressed into service to go into facts and events clothed
in the inner meanings, metaphors and analogies in the ancient Sanskrit
texts. There is now a willingness to recognize history in what was earlier
dismissed as myth and legend. And Indian scholars both in India and
abroad are rediscovering their roots and sharing them with scholars of the
world, with the added strengths of the objective attitudes, approaches and
methods of modern Science like Archeology, Ecology, Geology, Physics,

Chemistry, Genetics, Satellite Imaging, Astronomy, and Computerized
analysis of vast stores of data.

World-wide interest today is going far beyond a search for
historical facts, to areas of eternal human value, to a search for an
integrated vision of divinity and humanity as the ancients of India saw
them. This is best expressed in the message of the ancient Upanishads,
“Tat Tvam Asi”, translated as You (the human) Are the Same as That (the
divine). This message originating from ancient times in India is clearly
echoing today in the minds and hearts of mankind, far beyond the Indian
shores, The seeming socio-economic regress within India today is quite
clearly a superficial phenomenon, and is more than offset by the spread of
ancient Indian knowledge and values across the rest of the world, beyond
the material towards the spiritual, and a recognition by mankind that that
is where his destiny lies.

One of the most fascinating things about a study of the Rig Veda is
that it is so full of the past, so compelling in its influence in the present and
so reassuring for the future. It puts us in a Time Machine where Past,
Present and Future are reduced to chastening relativities in the larger
framework of endless Time, and gives us a better sense of what existence
is all about and what is our place and purpose in that framework. It
provides us with an endless thread of continuity, within a brief taste of
immortality.
One of the critical functions of history is to understand the past in
order to understand how to relate to the present and prepare for the future.
It cannot be merely in materialistic terms but also in terms of values that
are critical to meaningful living. It is simply not sufficient to look at facts
and events, as in Science, in a purely physical sense, completely sanitized
of all value elements. The truly great historians, like Arnold Toynbee and
Will Durant make history pf past ages come vividly to life, as real indeed as
the times we live in. Other historians present fossilized versions, often like
the fossils they rely on as evidence. The famous dramatist Kalidas once
said that he who teaches for profit is no teacher but a merchant. Many
historians of today are no different : often they are politicians not
historians, often in disguise, sometimes unabashedly undisguised. Many of
the historians, both Western and Indian, who have attempted to present the
history of ancient India, appear to belong to this category. Our great
misfortune is that it is their versions that find their way with official
approval into the textbooks of our schools and colleges of India.

Rebuilding history with material evidence is difficult enough.
Marauding hordes destroyed the greatest library of ancient times in
Alexandria. In our own times armed savages armed with guns addressed
their gunfire to the great Sphinx in Egypt and in more recent times, the
imposing Buddha at Bamian in Afghanistan. The building of the MultanSind Railway made use of bricks excavated at the sites of Harappa and
Mohenjo Daro, where it is hard to assess how much of history have been
thereby destroyed. And we still do not know how much lies buried lost to
History, under our vast built-up cities or cultivated farms, or areas
submerged by waters of our dams or even under the unexplored arid
deserts. Our archaeological discoveries are often no more than unwitting
accidents.
Every society has an inevitable mix of the materialistic and the
spiritual aspects of their culture and traditions, and so far we have been
seeing a predominance of the former in the West and of the latter in the
East. Today’s world of course, is seeing a two-way osmosis between them
and perhaps this will usher in a better and more balanced future for
mankind. But while these positive developments take place, we need to be
wary that biases of the past and the headlong rush for materialistic values
of the present do not weaken our ancient spiritual heritage. The wisdom of
ancient India may still have a critical part to play in forging a holistic world
vision to moderate the negative impacts of modern competetive and
acquisitive materialism that is creating the twin dangers of nuclear
proliferation and ecological disaster that could well wipe out humanity
more extensively and completely than Nature did with many an ancient
civilization.
The most perceptive and inspiring vision of the future are best
expressed in the words of Aurobindo : “We of the coming day stand at the
head of a new age of development which must lead to such a larger
synthesis…… We do not belong to past dawns, but the noons of the future. A
mass of new material is flowing into us; we have not only to assimilate the
influences of the great theistic religions of India and of the world, and a
recovered sense of the meaning of Buddhism, but to take full account of the
potent though limited revelations of modern knowledge and seeking; and
beyond that, the remote and dateless past which seemed to be dead, is
returning upon us with an effulgence of many luminous secrets long lost to
the consciousness of mankind, but now breaking out from behind the veil…..”

Appendix – A
What the world’s great minds have said about the
Indian heritage
Aurobindo (1872-1950)
India saw from the beginning, and, even in her ages of reason and her age of increasing
ignorance, she never lost hold of the insight, that life cannot be rightly seen in the sole
light, cannot be perfectly lived in the sole power of its externalities.
Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860)
“In the whole world there is no study, except that of the originals, so beneficial and so
elevating as that of the Upanishads. It has been the solace of my life, it will be the solace
of
my
death!”
Sir Monier Monier-Williams (1819-1899)
"It may be with truth be asserted that no description of Hinduism can be exhaustive which
does not touch on almost every religious and philosophical idea that the world has ever
known. It is all-tolerant, all-comprehensive, all-compliant, all-absorbing. It has its spiritual
and its material aspect; it’s esoteric and exoteric; it’s subjective and objective; it’s rational
and irrational. It has one side for the practical; another for the severely moral; another for
the devotional and the imaginative; another for the philosophical and speculative."
Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)
" I owed a magnificent day to the Bhagavad-Gita. It was as if an empire spoke to us,
nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence
which in another age and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions
which exercise us."
Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835)
“Bhagvad-Gita is the most beautiful, perhaps the only true philosophical song existing in
any known tongue…....perhaps the deepest and loftiest thing the world has to show."
Will Durant (1885-1981)
"Perhaps in return for conquest, arrogance and spoliation, India will teach us the tolerance
and gentleness of the mature mind, the quiet content of the unacquisitive soul, the calm of
the understanding spirit, and a unifying, a pacifying love for all living things."
Dr. Annie Besant (1847-1933)
“After a study of some forty years and more of the great religions of the world, I find none
so perfect, none so scientific, none so philosophic, and none so spiritual as the great
religion known by the name of Hinduism. The more you know it, the more you will love it;
the more you try to understand it, the more deeply you will value it”
Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862)

"In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the
Bhagavad Gita in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seems
puny."
Voltaire (1694-1778)
" I am convinced that everything has come down to us from the banks of the Ganges, astronomy, astrology, metempsychosis, etc."
Jules Michelet (1798-1874)
Each year, it is necessary to respire, to take breath again, to revive ourselves at the great
living sources that forever keep their eternal freshness. Where can we find them if not at
the cradle of our race, on the sacred summits from where descend the Indus and the
Ganges....?
Max Muller (1823-1900) :
“If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully developed
some of it’s choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered on the greatest problems of life, and
has found solutions of some of them which will deserve the attention even of those who
have studied Plato and Kant – I should point to India. And if I were to ask myself from what
literature we, here in Europe, we who have been nurtured almost exclusively in the
thoughts of Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw that
corrective which is most wanted in order to make our inner life more perfect, more
comprehensive, more universal, in fact, more truly a human life, not for this life only but a
transfigured and eternal life – again I should point to India”.
Swami Vivekananda (December, 1900, New York) :
"My whole life has been changed by the touch of one of those divine men about whom I
am going to speak to you next Sunday; and the time is coming when these thoughts will
be cast abroad over the whole world. Instead of living in monasteries, instead of being
confined to books of philosophy to be studied only by the learned, instead of being the
exclusive possession of sects, they will be sown broadcast over the whole world, so that
they may become the common property of the saint and the sinner, of men, women and
children, of the learned and the ignorant. They will then permeate the atmosphere of the
whole world, and the very air that we breathe will say with every one of its pulsations
“Thou art That ....... "
Romain Rolland (1866-1944)
If there is one place on the face of the earth where all the dreams of living men have found
a home from the very earliest days when man began the dream of existence, it is
India....For more than 30 centuries, the tree of vision, with all its thousand branches and
their millions of twigs, has sprung from this torrid land, the burning womb of the Gods. It
renews itself tirelessly showing no signs of decay.
Niels Bohr, (1885-1962)
I go into the Upanishads to ask questions.

Erwin Schrödinger (1887--1961)
This life of yours which you are living is not merely apiece of this entire existence, but in a
certain sense the whole; only this whole is not so constituted that it can be surveyed in
one single glance. This, as we know, is what the Brahmins express in that sacred, mystic
formula which is yet really so simple and so clear; tat tvam asi, this is you. Or, again, in
such words as "I am in the east and the west, I am above and below, I am this entire
world."

Dr. Carl Sagan, (1934-1996)
The Hindu religion is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to the idea that the
Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths. It
is the only religion in which the time scales correspond, to those of modern scientific
cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma,
8.64 billion years long. Longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half the time
since the Big Bang. And there are much longer time scales still.
The most elegant and sublime of these is a representation of the creation of the universe
at the beginning of each cosmic cycle, a motif known as the cosmic dance of Lord Shiva.
The god, called in this manifestation Nataraja, the Dance King. In the upper right hand is a
drum whose sound is the sound of creation. In the upper left hand is a tongue of flame, a
reminder that the universe, now newly created, with billions of years from now will be
utterly destroyed.
A millennium before Europeans were willing to divest themselves of the Biblical idea that
the world was a few thousand years old, the Mayans were thinking of millions and the
Hindus billions.
Count Hermann Keyserling (1880-1946)
Benares is holy. Europe, grown superficial, hardly understands such truths anymore.....I
feel nearer here than I have ever done to the heart of the world; here I feel everyday as if
soon, perhaps even today, I would receive the grace of supreme revelation...The
atmosphere of devotion which hangs above the river is improbable in strength; stronger
than in any church that I have ever visited. Every would be Christian priest would do well
to sacrifice a year of his theological studies in order to spend his time on the Ganges; here
he would discover what piety means.
Mark Twain (1835-1910)
Land of religions, cradle of human race, birthplace of human speech, grandmother of
legend, great grandmother of tradition. The land that all men desire to see and having seen
once even by a glimpse, would not give that glimpse for the shows of the rest of the globe
combined.
Dr. Arnold J. Toynbee (1889-1975).
It is already becoming clear that a chapter which had a Western beginning will have to
have an Indian ending if it is not to end in self-destruction of the human race. At this
supremely dangerous moment in human history , the only way of salvation is the ancient
Hindu way. Here we have the attitude and spirit that can make it possible for the human
race to grow together in to a single family.

So now we turn to India. This spiritual gift, that makes a man human, is still alive in Indian
souls. Go on giving the world Indian examples of it. Nothing else can do so much to help
mankind to save itself from destruction.
There may or may not be only one single absolute truth and only one single ultimate way
of salvation. We do not know. But we do know that there are more approaches to truth
than one, and more means of salvation than one. This is a hard saying for adherents of the
higher religions of the Judaic family (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), but it is a truism
for Hindus. The spirit of mutual good-will, esteem, and veritable love ... is the traditional
spirit of the religions of the Indian family. This is one of India’s gifts to the world.
At the close of this century, the world would be dominated by the West, but that in the 21st
century "India will conquer her conquerors."
Albert Einstein, (1879-1955)
When I read the Bhagavad Gita and reflect about how God created this universe
everything else seems so superfluous. We owe a lot to Indians who taught us how to
count, without which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made.
Julius Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967)
Access to the Vedas is the greatest privilege this century may claim over all previous
centuries.
The general notions about human understanding… which are illustrated by discoveries in
atomic physics are not in the nature of things wholly unfamiliar, wholly unheard of or new.
Even in our own culture they have a history, and in Buddhist and Hindu thought a more
considerable and central place. What we shall find [in modern physics] is an
exemplification, an encouragement, and a refinement of old wisdom.
The juxtaposition of Western civilization's most terrifying scientific achievement with the
most dazzling description of the mystical experience given to us by the Bhagavad Gita,
India's greatest literary monument.
Octavio Paz (1914-1998 )
The Hindu genius is a love for abstraction and, at the same time, a passion for the
concrete image. At times it is rich, at others prolix. It has created the most lucid and the
most instinctive art. It is abstract and realistic, sexual and intellectual, pedantic and
sublime. It lives between extremes, it embraces the extremes, rooted in the earth and
drawn to an invisible beyond.
Queen Fredricka of Greece (1931- 1981)
It was my advanced research in physics that had started me on a spiritual quest. It
culminated in me accepting the non-dualism or absolute monism of Shankara as my
philosophy of life and science.
You are fortunate to inherit such knowledge. I envy you. While Greece is the country of my
birth, India is the country of my soul.
Klaus L. Klostermaier (Born 1933)
Hinduism has proven much more open than any other religion to new ideas, scientific
thought, and social experimentation. Many concepts like reincarnation, meditation, yoga
and others have found worldwide acceptance. It would not be surprising to find Hinduism

the dominant religion of the twenty-first century. It would be a religion that doctrinally is
less clear-cut than mainstream Christianity, politically less determined than Islam,
ethically less heroic than Buddhism, but it would offer something to everybody. It will
appear idealistic to those who look for idealism, pragmatic to the pragmatists, spiritual to
the seekers, sensual to the here-and-now generation. Hinduism, by virtue of its lack of an
ideology and its reliance on intuition, will appear to be more plausible than those religions
whose doctrinal positions petrified a thousand years ago.
George Bernard Shaw, (1856-1950)
The Indian way of life provides the vision of the natural, real way of life. We veil ourselves
with unnatural masks. On the face of India are the tender expressions which carry the
mark of the Creators hand.
The apparent multiplication of gods is bewildering at the first glance, but you soon
discover that they are the same GOD. There is always one uttermost God who defies
personification. This makes Hinduism the most tolerant religion in the world, because its
one transcendent God includes all possible gods. In fact Hinduism is so elastic and so
subtle that the most profound Methodist, and crudest idolater, are equally at home with it.
Christopher W. B. Isherwood (1904-1986)
I believe the Gita to be one of the major religious documents of the world. If its teachings
did not seem to me to agree with those of the other gospels and scriptures, then my own
system of values would be thrown into confusion, and I should feel completely bewildered.
The Gita is not simply a sermon, but a philosophical treatise.
Sir Charles Eliot (1862-1931)
I do not think that Christianity will ever make much progress in Asia, for what is commonly
known by that name is not the teaching of Christ but a rearrangement of it made in Europe
and like most European institutions practical rather than thoughtful. And as for the
teaching of Christ himself, the Indian finds it excellent but not ample or satisfying. There is
little in it which cannot be found in some of the many scriptures of Hinduism..."
The claim of India to the attention of the world is that she, more than any other nation
since history began, has devoted herself to contemplating the ultimate mysteries of
existence and, in my eyes, the fact that Indian thought diverges widely from our own
popular thought is a positive merit.
Hinduism has not been made, but has grown. It is a jungle, not a building. It is a living
example of a great national paganism such as might have existed in Europe if Christianity
had not become the state religion of the Roman Empire, if there had remained an
incongruous jumble of old local superstitions, Greek philosophy, and oriental cults such
as the worship of Sarapis or Mitras.
Compared to Islam and Christianity, Hinduism’s doctrines are extraordinarily fluid, and
multiform. India deals in images and metaphors. Restless, subtle and argumentative as
Hindu thought is, it is less prone than European theology to the vice of distorting
transcendental ideas by too stringent definition. It adumbrates the indescribable by
metaphors and figures. It is not afraid of inconsistencies which may illustrate different
aspects of the infinite, but it rarely tries to cramp the divine within the limits of a logical
phrase.

The Hindu has an extraordinary power of combining dogma and free thought, uniformity,
and variety. Utmost latitude of interpretation is allowed. In all ages Hindus have been
passionately devoted to speculation. It is also to point out that from the Upanishads down
to the writings of Tagore in the present day literature from time to time enunciates the idea
that the whole universe is the manifestation of some exuberant force giving expression to
itself in joyous movement.
Muhammad Dara Shikoh (1627-1658 AD) the favorite Sufi son of Moghul emperor, Shah
Jehan.
After gradual research; I have come to the conclusion that long before all heavenly books,
God had revealed to the Hindus, through the Rishis of yore, of whom Brahma was the
Chief, His four books of knowledge, the Rig Veda, the Yajur Veda, the Sama Veda and the
Atharva Veda. The Quran itself made veiled references to the Upanishads as the first
heavenly book and the fountainhead of the ocean of monotheism.
Annie Wood Besant (1847-1933)
After a study of some forty years and more of the great religions of the world, I find none
so perfect , none so scientific, none so philosophical and none so spiritual that the great
religion known by the name of Hinduism. Make no mistake, without Hinduism, India has no
future. Hinduism is the soil in to which India's roots are stuck and torn out of that she will
inevitably wither as a tree torn out from its place. And if Hindus do not maintain Hinduism
who shall save it? If India's own children do not cling to her faith who shall guard it. India
alone can save India and India and Hinduism are one.
This is the India of which I speak - the India which, as I said, is to me the Holy Land. For
those who, though born for this life in a Western land and clad in a Western body, can yet
look back to earlier incarnations in which they drank the milk of spiritual wisdom from the
breast of their true mother - they must feel ever the magic of her immemorial past, must
dwell ever under the spell of her deathless fascination; for they are bound to India by all
the sacred memories of their past; and with her, too, are bound up all the radiant hopes of
their future, a future which they know they will share with her who is their true mother in
the soul-life.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888–1975), President of India (1962-1967).
Hinduism is not just a faith. It is the union of reason and intuition that can not be defined
but is only to be experienced. Evil and error are not ultimate. There is no Hell, for that
[1]
means there is a place where God is not, and there are sins which exceed his love.
Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862)
In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the
Bhagavad Gita in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny
and trivial.
What extracts from the Vedas I have read fall on me like the light of a higher and purer
luminary, which describes a loftier course through purer stratum. It rises on me like the
full moon after the stars have come out, wading through some far stratum in the sky.
Whenever I have read any part of the Vedas, I have felt that some unearthly and unknown
light illuminated me. In the great teaching of the Vedas, there is no touch of sectarianism.
It is of all ages, climes and nationalities and is the royal road for the attainment of the

Great Knowledge. When I am at it, I feel that I am under the spangled heavens of a summer
night.
The Vedas contain a sensible account of God. The veneration in which the Vedas are held
is itself a remarkable feat. Their code embraced the whole moral life of the Hindus and in
such a case there is no other truth than sincerity. Truth is such by reference to the heart of
man within, not to any standard without.
The Hindus are most serenely and thoughtfully religious than the Hebrews. They have
perhaps a purer, more independent and impersonal knowledge of God. Their religious
books describes the first inquisitive and contemplative access to God.
Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)
I owed a magnificent day to the Bhagavad-Gita. It was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing
small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which in
another age and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which
exercise us.
It is sublime as night and a breathless ocean. It contains every religious sentiment, all the
grand ethics which visit in turn each noble poetic mind.... The Indian teaching, through its
clouds of legends, has yet a simple and grand religion, like a queenly countenance seen
through a rich veil. It teaches to speak truth, love others, and to dispose trifles. The East is
grand - and makes Europe appear the land of trifles. ...all is soul and the soul is Vishnu .
Will Durant (1885-1981)
It is true that even across the Himalayan barrier India has sent to us such questionable
gifts as grammar and logic, philosophy and fables, hypnotism and chess, and above all
our numerals and our decimal system. But these are not the essence of her spirit; they are
trifles compared to what we may learn from her in the future. Perhaps in return for
conquest, arrogance and spoliation, India will teach us the tolerance and gentleness of the
mature mind, the quiet content of the unacquisitive soul, the calm of the understanding
spirit, and a unifying, a pacifying love for all living things.
India was the motherland of our race, and Sanskrit the mother of Europe's languages: she
was the mother of our philosophy; mother, through the Arabs, of much of our
mathematics; mother, through the Buddha, of the ideals embodied in Christianity; mother,
through the village community, of self-government and democracy. Mother India is in
many ways the mother of us all. Nothing should more deeply shame the modern student
than the recency and inadequacy of his acquaintance with India....This is the India that
patient scholarship is now opening up like a new intellectual continent to that Western
mind which only yesterday thought civilization an exclusive Western thing. "As flowing
rivers disappear in the sea, losing their name and form, thus a wise man, freed from name
and form, goes to the divine person who is beyond all." Such a theory of life and death will
not please Western man, whose religion is as permeated with individualism as are his
political and economic institutions. But it has satisfied the philosophical Hindu mind with
astonishing continuity. Even in Europe and America, this wistful theosophy has won
millions upon millions of followers, from lonely women and tired men to Schopenhauer
and Emerson.
